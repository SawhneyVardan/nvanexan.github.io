### Background

The General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR") is set to replace the Data Protection Directive 95/46/ec (the "Directive") effective May 25, 2018. The GDPR contains a number of new protections for EU data subjects and threatens significant fines and penalties for non-compliant data controllers and processors once it comes into force in the spring of 2018.

**Importantly, the GDPR is not just a European law. It has worldwide application. If you operate a Canadian company that markets goods or services to EU residents, you may be viewed as subject to the GDPR.**

The following article provides a brief summary of the key changes brought about by the GDPR and what Canadian companies should do now to start preparing for its coming into force next May. As explained in more detail below, if you haven't heard of the GDPR and haven't put in place data mapping solutions in your organization, now is the time to start wrapping your arms around the data you are collecting and mapping out a strategy to get to GDPR compliance.

### Key Changes Under the GDPR

The GDPR brings with it a number of important changes to existing European privacy law. The key operational changes relevant to Canadian organizations are set out below.

#### Territorial scope

Article 3 of the GDPR states that the Regulation applies to the processing of personal data of data subjects located in the EU, even if the relevant controller or processor is not established in the EU, provided that the processing relates to the offering of goods or services to the data subjects (whether or not payment is required), or the monitoring of data subjects’ behavior.

In practical terms, this means that any Canadian company that markets goods or services to EU residents may be viewed as subject to the GDPR, regardless of whether the company is located or uses equipment in the EU or not. So if you have an app in the Apple App Store, and it is marketed at EU residents and does collect data from EU residents, you are potentially subject to the GDPR.


#### Unique identifiers as personal information

#### No profiling


#### Other key data subject rights

Users or data subjects have many other rights under the GDPR, including:

- Right to portability

  - Article 18 of the GDPR grants data subjects a “right to portability” with regard to personal data of theirs that is automatically processed. This provision allows data subjects to more easily transfer their personal data from one controller to another, which will come in handy when, for example, a data subject wishes to change service providers and transfer his or her personal data from one service provider to another.

- Right to erasure

  - Article 17 sets out the “right to erasure,” also known as the “right to be forgotten,” which gives a data subject the right to order a controller to erase any of the data subject’s personal data in certain situations. Article 17 requires a controller to erase a data subject’s personal data “without undue delay” when the personal data is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which it was collected or processed, or the data subject withdraws his or her consent or objects to the processing and there is no other legal basis for the processing, among other grounds.


#### Data breach notification

Article 31 of the Regulation sets out a single data breach notification requirement designed to be applicable across the EU. The rule requires controllers to notify the appropriate supervisory authority of the personal data breach within 72 hours of learning about the breach. The notification must describe the nature of the personal data breach, the categories and approximate number of data subjects implicated, the contact information of the organization’s data protection officer, the likely consequences of the breach, and the measures the controller has taken or proposes to take to address and mitigate the breach. Additionally, a processor is required to notify a controller of a data breach “without undue delay.”

Article 32 requires controllers to notify data subjects of breaches “[w]hen the personal data breach is likely to result in a high risk [to] the rights and freedoms of individuals” and must notify data subjects of the breach “without undue delay.” The notification must include the contact information of the company’s data protection officer, the likely consequences of the breach, and the remediation and/or rectification measures the company has taken or intends to take to address the breach. However, the controller does not have to provide notice to data subjects if the controller (1) had implemented “appropriate technical and organisational protection measures” and applied those measures to the affected data; (2) took subsequent measures to ensure that the risk to data subjects’ rights and freedoms would be “no longer likely to materialize;” or (3) notification would require “disproportionate effort,” in which case a public communication would be sufficient as long as the data subjects were notified “in an equally effective manner.”


#### Increased penalties

The penalties available under the GDPR are potentially very large and should be taken seriously. Specifically, the GDPR creates two tiers of maximum fines:

- **Tier 1:** 10 million euros, or 2% of a company’s worldwide annual turnover, *whichever is higher*
- **Tier 2:** 20 million euros, or 4% of a company's worldwide annual turnover, *whichever is higher*

Which tier will apply depends on the nature of the violation and whether the data controller or data processor committed any previous violations. The Tier 2 threshold will apply for more serious violations by controllers and processors, such as:

- Basic principles for processing data, including consent (Articles 5-7, 9);
- Data subjects’ rights (Articles 12-22);
- Data transfer provisions (Articles 44-49);
- Obligations to Member State laws including the right to freedom of expression and information, collection and use of national identification numbers, employment processing, secrecy obligations, and data protection rules for churches and religious associations. (Chapter IX); and
- Non-compliance with an order or a temporary or definitive limitation on processing or suspension of data flows by a supervisory authority (Articles 58(1), 58(2)).

Moreover, the GDPR allows data subjects to seek monetary damages in court from controllers who violate their rights and from processors as well if the processors are liable for a data breach, violate the processor-specific provisions of the GDPR, or act outside a controller’s lawful instruction. Specifically, under Article 79, data subjects may bring an action for damages or compensation before the courts of the Member State state where they reside. They also may bring the action in any Member State State where the controller or processor has an establishment. Importantly, individual causes of action are independent from and without prejudice to an action by a supervisory authority to impose administrative fines.
