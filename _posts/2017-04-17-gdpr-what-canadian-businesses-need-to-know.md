### A Brief Primer on the GDPR

The [General Data Protection Regulation ("**GDPR**")](http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/reform/files/regulation_oj_en.pdf) is the EU's new omnibus data protection law that is set to replace the existing 20-year-old Data Protection Directive 95/46/ec (the "**Directive**") on May 25, 2018. The GDPR is sweeping and ambitious regulation. It contains a number of new protections for EU data subjects and threatens significant fines and penalties for non-compliant data controllers and processors once it comes into force.

**Importantly, the GDPR's relevance expands far beyond Europe. The Regulation has worldwide application. If you operate a Canadian company that markets goods or services to EU residents, or monitors EU residents, you may be viewed as subject to the GDPR and its corresponding fines and penalties.**

The following article provides a brief primer on the GDPR and what Canadian companies need to know to start preparing for the GDPR coming into force next next May. If you haven't yet heard of the GDPR, now is the time to start wrapping your arms around the data your organization is collecting and mapping out a strategy for GDPR compliance.

### Key Changes & New Concepts

The GDPR brings with it a number of important changes to existing European privacy law. The key operational changes relevant to Canadian organizations are set out below.

#### Territorial Scope

Article 3 of the GDPR states that the Regulation applies to the processing of personal data of data subjects located in the EU, even if the relevant controller or processor is not established in the EU, provided that the processing relates to the offering of goods or services to the data subjects (whether or not payment is required), or the monitoring of data subjects’ behaviour.

In practical terms, this means that any Canadian company that markets goods or services to EU residents or monitors the behaviour of individuals within the EU may be viewed as subject to the GDPR, regardless of whether the company has a physical presence in the EU. So if you have an app in the Apple App Store, and it is marketed at EU residents and does collect data from EU residents, you are potentially subject to the GDPR. So, too, if you monitor the behaviour of EU citizens for the purposes of analytics or online behavioural advertising.

#### Enhanced Consent Requirements

Consent remains a lawful basis to transfer personal data under the GDPR; however, the definition of consent is significantly narrower than before. Whereas the Directive allowed controllers to rely on implicit and "opt-out" consent in some circumstances, the GDPR requires the data subject to signal agreement by "a statement or a clear affirmative action".[^1] Specifically, consent under the GDPR means:

> any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her.

Importantly, "silence, pre-ticked boxes or inactivity," are presumed inadequate to confer consent.[^2]

Article 7 of the GDPR also adds that consent must be specific to each data processing operation. To meet this requirement, a request for consent to data processing must be "clearly distinguishable" from any other matters in a written document, and it must be provided "in an intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language".[^3]

#### Unique Identifiers as Personal Data

Under the GDPR, unique identifiers such as IP addresses and device IDs are considered 'personal data'.[^4] This is important because many companies do track IP addresses or track users with custom unique identifiers for advertising and analytics purposes. Whereas before the legal nature of such information was at times ambiguous, the GDPR makes it clear that such information may now be deemed personal data and therefore subject to regulation.

The GDPR does not apply to data that "does not relate to an identified or identifiable natural person or to data rendered anonymous in such a way that the data subject is no longer identifiable."

#### Incentives to Use Pseudonymous Data

The GDPR introduces a new concept in European data protection law – "pseudonymisation" – for a process rendering data neither anonymous nor directly identifying. Pseudonymisation is the separation of data from *direct* identifiers so that linkage to an identity is not possible without additional information that is held separately.

Pseudonymous data is not exempt from the GDPR. It is not anonymous data and there is, therefore, the risk that it could ultimately be re-identified with the original data subject. The GDPR does, however, create incentives for data controllers to use pseudonymisation. For example, pseudonymisation may facilitate processing personal data beyond original collection purposes.[^5] The technique can also be used to meet the GDPR's data security requirements under Article 32 and controllers do not need to provide data subjects with access, rectification, erasure or data portability if they can no longer identify a data subject.[^6]

#### New Data Subject Rights

Users or data subjects have many new rights under the GDPR, including:

- **Right to portability**

	- Article 18 of the GDPR grants data subjects a "right to portability" with regard to personal data of theirs that is automatically processed. This provision allows data subjects to more easily transfer their personal data from one controller to another, for example, when a data subject wishes to change internet service providers.

- **Right to erasure**

	- Article 17 sets out the "right to erasure," also known as the "right to be forgotten," which gives a data subject the right to order a controller to erase any of the data subject’s personal data in certain situations.
	- Article 17 requires a controller to erase a data subject’s personal data "without undue delay" when the personal data is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which it was collected or processed, or the data subject withdraws his or her consent or objects to the processing and there is no other legal basis for the processing, among other grounds.

- **Right to not be profiled**

	- Article 22 provides data subjects a right to not be profiled. Profiling under the GDPR means "any form of automated processing of personal data consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects concerning that natural person's performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, location or movements".[^7]

#### Data Breach Notifications

Articles 33 and 34 of the GDPR set out data breach notification requirements.[^8]

Article 33 requires controllers to notify the appropriate supervisory authority of the personal data breach "without undue delay" and in any event within 72 hours of learning about a breach.

The notification must describe:

-  the nature of the personal data breach;
-  the categories and approximate number of data subjects implicated;
-  the contact information of the organization’s data protection officer;
-  the likely consequences of the breach; and
-  the measures the controller has taken or proposes to take to address and mitigate the breach.

Article 34 requires controllers to notify data subjects of breaches "[w]hen the personal data breach is likely to result in a high risk [to] the rights and freedoms of individuals".  Data subjects must also be notified of the breach "without undue delay."

A data controller does not have to provide notice to data subjects, however, if:

- the controller has implemented appropriate technical and organizational protection measures, and those measures were applied to the personal data affected by the personal data breach, in particular those that render the personal data unintelligible to any person who is not authorised to access it, such as encryption;

- has taken subsequent measures which ensure that the high risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects is no longer likely to materialise; or

- it would involve disproportionate effort. In such a case, there shall instead be a public communication or similar measure whereby the data subjects are informed in an equally effective manner.

Canadian companies should know that while mandatory breach notifications exist in Alberta, they do not as yet exist under PIPEDA. The mandatory breach notification requirement under PIPEDA will also be coming into force in 2018. Accordingly, Canadian companies should be examining their policies regarding breach notifications for potential compliance with both PIPEDA and the GDPR at this time.

#### Increased Penalties

The penalties available under the GDPR are potentially very large and should be taken seriously. Specifically, the GDPR creates two tiers of maximum fines:

- **Tier 1:** 10 million euros, or 2% of a company’s worldwide annual turnover, *whichever is higher*
- **Tier 2:** 20 million euros, or 4% of a company's worldwide annual turnover, *whichever is higher*

Which tier will apply depends on the nature of the violation and whether the data controller or data processor committed any previous violations. The Tier 2 threshold will apply for more serious violations by controllers and processors, such as violations of:

- basic principles for processing data, including consent (Articles 5-7, 9);
- data subjects’ rights (Articles 12-22);
- data transfer provisions (Articles 44-49);
- obligations to Member State laws, including the right to freedom of expression and information, collection and use of national identification numbers, employment processing, secrecy obligations, and data protection rules for churches and religious associations. (Chapter IX); and
- non-compliance with an order or a temporary or definitive limitation on processing or suspension of data flows by a supervisory authority (Articles 58(1), 58(2)).

Moreover, the GDPR allows data subjects to seek monetary damages in court from controllers who violate their rights and from processors as well if the processors are liable for a data breach, violate the processor-specific provisions of the GDPR, or act outside a controller’s lawful instruction.

Specifically, under Article 79, data subjects may bring an action for damages or compensation before the courts of the Member State state where they reside. They also may bring the action in any Member State State where the controller or processor has an establishment. Importantly, individual causes of action are independent from and without prejudice to an action by a supervisory authority to impose administrative fines.

### Conclusion and Roadmap to Success

The GDPR is comprehensive data protection legislation that may significantly impact Canadian businesses collecting data in the EU or monitoring data subjects in the EU. Given the severity of the fines and penalties, the GDPR should be taken seriously, particularly by large and established organizations in the technology sector.

Among the most important actions which organizations should take in preparing to comply with the GDPR, focus should initially be given to data mapping. Specifically, you should look to identify all of the sources of collection of your data and drawing a clear map of the lifecycle of that data throughout your organization. Unless and until you have wrapped your arms around your organization's data, you will not know where your main risks and liabilities lie.

Once you have mapped your data, other key action items for compliance should include:

- reviewing existing data protection policies, codes of conduct and training to ensure these are consistent with the GDPR's revised principles
- identify means to "demonstrate compliance", e.g. through data mapping, pseudonimisation and de-identification policies, and privacy impact assessments
- review your existing consents to ensure that your quality of consent meets the new requirements, specifically:
	- consent is active and does not rely on silence, inactivity or pre-ticked boxes
	- consent is presented in a manner which is clearly distinguishable from the other matters, in an intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language
	- supply of services is not made contingent on consent to processing that is not necessary for the service being supplied
	- data subjects are informed of their right to withdraw consent at any time
- where possible, incorporate pseudonymisation and [privacy by design](http://www.science20.com/newswire/landmark_resolution_passed_preserve_future_privacy) into your software development process (Agile, SCRUM, design sprints, etc.)
- review your existing policies regarding data breach notification requirements for compliance not only with PIPEDA but also the GDPR.

Organizations that begin taking steps now, to comply with the GDPR, will be better positioned to meet their legal obligations when the legislation comes into force, and thereby avoid potentially significant penalties.
