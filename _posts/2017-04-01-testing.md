Well. Finally got around to putting this old website together. Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.

**The Law of Privacy re Web Tracking by Third Party Advertisers**

---

{{TOC}}

# Introduction

This memorandum examines the law of privacy in Canada and, specifically, its application to web tracking by advertisers. The question this memorandum seeks to answer is whether web tracking by advertisers is contrary to any statutory or common laws in Canada, and if so, to what degree.

The focus of the memorandum is on web tracking via computer or mobile browsers. The digital advertising industry's tracking methods in the browser have evolved significantly over the last 10 years from simple cookies to include newer methods like device fingerprinting ([discussed in more detail below](#fingerprinting)), but the browser is still the predominant locus of web tracking activity. Newer "internet of things" ("**IOT**") technologies, such as televisions,[^Kimberley B. Johnson, "Samsung Warns Customers Not To Share Personal Info In Front Of SmartTVs" Konbini, [http://www.konbini.com/ng/lifestyle/samsung-warns-customers-not-share-personal-info-front-smarttvs/](http://www.konbini.com/ng/lifestyle/samsung-warns-customers-not-share-personal-info-front-smarttvs/).] mobile phones,[^Andrew Griffin, "Google voice search records and keeps conversations people have around their phones – but the files can be deleted", Independent, [http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/google-voice-search-records-stores-conversation-people-have-around-their-phones-but-files-can-be-a7059376.html](http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/google-voice-search-records-stores-conversation-people-have-around-their-phones-but-files-can-be-a7059376.html).] and smart home devices[^Tim Moynihan, "Alexa and Google Home Record What You Say. But What Happens to That Data?", Wired, [https://www.wired.com/2016/12/alexa-and-google-record-your-voice/](https://www.wired.com/2016/12/alexa-and-google-record-your-voice/).] pose similar surveillance concerns. While this memorandum does not focus on these technologies, its analysis remains relevant to the same privacy issues those technologies engage.

This memorandum is also primarily focused on "third party" advertisers engaged in Online Behavioural Advertising ("**OBA**"), not "first party" content publishers or advertisers. First party websites, such as theglobeandmail.com or even Facebook, have terms of use and privacy policies that users arguably consent to when they voluntarily direct their browser to those websites to consume the content at those domains. Third parties serve advertisements to you from their own servers on those same sites, even though you may not know who they are or do not desire your browser to access their servers. These advertising companies, sometimes referred to as demand-side platforms ("**DSPs**"), are primarily responsible for web tracking and operate in a more legally precarious zone wherein users often have no knowledge of their identity and so cannot meaningfully receive notice of, or give consent to, the web tracking methods they employ. Because the notice and consent issues surrounding "third parties" pose a greater concern for user privacy, this memo focuses on their web tracking practices and the law surrounding them.

This memorandum proceeds in three parts. Part I provides an executive summary of the memorandum's findings and conclusions. Part II provides a factual overview of web tracking and how online behavioural advertising works. Part III examines the statutory and common law causes of action that are relevant to this conduct.

# I. Executive Summary

This memorandum arrives at the following conclusions:

- Web tracking by third party advertisers for the purposes of OBA is pervasive across networked devices and often occurs without user knowledge of who is collecting the information, what information is being collected, how that information is being used, to whom that information might be sold or disclosed, and how to effectively opt-out.
- The information collected by third party advertisers varies greatly but at a minimum typically includes a user's browsing history, location, internet service provider ("**ISP**"), internet protocol ("**IP**") address, unique identifiers ("**UIDs**") at the hardware and software level, and information regarding the hardware profile of a device.
- The information collected by third party advertisers is in some cases anonymous, but is more often pseudonymous, linking devices to UIDs. This means that the advertiser may not know that the information collected is that of John Smith, but it does know that the very same device that accessed website A is now also accessing website B.
- When combined with other information, including one's social networking username, new research suggests that much of the so-called anonymous or pseudonymous information that is collected can in fact be used to identify or re-identify a specific user.
- The amount and sensitivity of information collected by third party advertisers, and their efforts to sell that information to data brokers or combine that information for identification and re-identification purposes, is difficult to discern from an analysis of network traffic. While anecdotal investigation of network traffic reveals companies engaged in device fingerprinting, how the information is ultimately used is a bit of a black box requiring further research and investigation by information security specialists.
- The privacy policies of third party advertisers are not typically made available to visitors of a first party website, and opt-out methods through the Network Advertising Initiative ("**NAI**"), the Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada ("**DAAC**") and the Digital Advertising Alliance ("**DAA**") typically apply only to cookies, which are now generally being replaced by newer forms of web tracking.
- The law as it relates to this kind of conduct is novel and untested without much precedent for guidance. However, there are grounds to argue that this conduct runs contrary to:
	- the *Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act* ("**PIPEDA**");[^S.C. 2000, c. 5. Available at: [http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/P-8.6/FullText.html](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/P-8.6/FullText.html).]
	- the malware-related provisions of *Canada's Anti-Spam Legislation* ("**CASL**");[^S.C. 2010, c. 23. The Official name of the statute is *An Act to promote the efficiency and adaptability of the Canadian economy by regulating certain activities that discourage reliance on electronic means of carrying out commercial activities, and to amend the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission Act, the Competition Act, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act and the Telecommunications Act*, but will herein be referred to as CASL. Available at: [http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/E-1.6/FullText.html](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/E-1.6/FullText.html).]
	- the provincial privacy acts of British Columbia, Manitoba, Newfoundland and Labrador and Saskatchewan, each of which establish a statutory tort of breach of privacy in those provinces; and
	- the common law tort of breach of privacy, specifically the tort of intrusion upon seclusion.
- Where a third party advertiser has misrepresented its privacy policy and opt-out technology, claims related to false or misleading representations under the *Competition Act* and torts such as deceit may also be relevant.[^R.S.C., 1985, c. C-34. Available at: [http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-34/FullText.html](http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-34/FullText.html).] These causes of action are not canvassed in detail in this memo but can be further investigated if and when facts demonstrate the need.
- To succeed in a claim for breach of privacy under PIPEDA, one must show that the information collected is personally identifiable information, and to the extent possible, of a sensitive nature. One must also demonstrate that the information was collected, used or disclosed without the individual's consent. The sensitivity of the information at issue will affect the level of notice required for there to be meaningful, *informed* consent, as required under the Act.
- To succeed in a claim for intrusion upon seclusion, one must demonstrate:
	- an intentional act (which includes recklessness);
	- an invasion, without lawful justification, of the plaintiff's private affairs or concerns; and
	- a reasonable person would regard the invasion as highly offensive causing distress, humiliation or anguish.
- As with PIPEDA, the central issues in any action under the common law tort of intrusion upon seclusion are (1) the personal and sensitive nature of the information; and (2) consent (*i.e.* lawful justification).
- The prospect of a successful claim against a third party advertiser will be greater where it can be shown that (1) the information collected concerned an individual's financials, health or sexual orientation; or (2) the advertiser acted contrary to the terms of its privacy policy.
- In the absence of these factual patterns, it may be difficult to make a successful claim. Web tracking by advertisers at an anonymous or pseudonymous level is so pervasive and underpins so much of the economic model of free content on the internet that a court would not likely be interested in disrupting the *status quo* in the absence of compelling and more serious facts that demonstrate "highly offensive" invasions of privacy.
- Nominal damages may be awarded for breach of intrusion upon seclusion; however, disgorgement of profits obtained by advertisers could also likely be sought under the doctrine of waiver of tort, with other torts and potentially breaches of PIPEDA forming the predicate wrongdoing for a disgorgement remedy.

# II. The Facts

## Anatomy of a Web Request

To understand the privacy law implications of this memorandum, it's important to understand the basic anatomy of how the internet serves content to end users.

When you direct your browser to a web address, such as nytimes.com, your browser (the HTTP client) makes an HTTP request to the nytimes.com server in the form of a request message that includes:

- **A request line:** specifies a request method (more on that below) and a request Uniform Resource Identifier ("**URI**"), *e.g.* GET http://nytimes.com.
- **A request header:** allows the client to pass additional information about the request, and about the client itself, to the server.
- **A message body:** this is optional, and is used to pass a payload of data or information from the client to the server.

The four key types of HTTP request methods are:

- **GET requests**: used to retrieve information from the given server using a given URI. Requests using GET should only retrieve data and should have no other effect on the data.
- **POST requests:** used to send data to the server, for example, customer information, file upload, etc.
- **PUT requests:** used to modify existing data, it replaces all the current representations of the target resource with the uploaded content.
- **DELETE requests:** used to delete existing data, it removes all the current representations of the target resource given by URI.

An example HTTP request might look something like this:

```
GET /hello.html HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE5.01; Windows NT)
Host: www.nytimes.com
Accept-Language: en-us
```

In this example, the User-Agent, Host and Accept-Language are all part of the request header. Much information about your browser and device can be communicated through the request header and custom fields can also be added to pass along additional information. Verizon, for example, used to inject a UID into every mobile request for a web page that made it easier for third party advertisers to track a specific device's browsing habits. [^See Jonathan Mayer, "The Turn-Verizon Zombie Cookie", Web Policy, [http://webpolicy.org/2015/01/14/turn-verizon-zombie-cookie/](http://webpolicy.org/2015/01/14/turn-verizon-zombie-cookie/).]

When you request to see the homepage at http://nytimes.com, you make a GET request to the New York Times server. You ask the server to find all of the files associated with that URL and send those files to your browser for rendering. The primary file you receive back is usually an HTML file, which creates the structure of the page and includes a manifest of all files that need to be loaded to render the page.  These include CSS files (which set out the design and display of the page), JavaScript files ("JS" files, which create the real programming layer in the web application and are often responsible for interactivity but also things like web tracking), and various image files (PNGs, JPGs, GIFs, etc.).  

![*An example of an HTTP request to nytimes.com*](images/ss1.png)

So when you go to nytimes.com, you are served an HTML file, which in turn has links to a number of CSS, JavaScript and image files, which your browser then makes additional GET requests to download and render within the HTML page.

JavaScript files are important because they actually contain powerful code that can be used to interact with and control your browser and / or your device and make POST requests to other websites without your knowledge. Google, for example, once used code to command users' web browsers to automatically submit a hidden form to Google when users visited websites embedded with Google advertisements so that it could defeat the cookie blocking settings used in Apple's safari browser.[^See Jonathan Mayer, "Safari Trackers", Web Policy, [http://webpolicy.org/2012/02/17/safari-trackers/](http://webpolicy.org/2012/02/17/safari-trackers/).]

Image files, though seemingly innocuous, are also important in the field of web tracking because they can be used as "beacons". Beacons are invisible 1px images that are embedded in a web page to send data back to a server. They are used frequently in email marketing campaigns to determine when a user has actually viewed or opened an email, and are used in other websites to track other kinds of information.

Below is an example of a beacon being used by a third party advertising company, Krux Digital LLC ("**Krux**"), on theglobeandmail.com to identify information about an ad partner that is being served on this page.

![*A beacon being used by a third party advertising network, Krux, on theglobeandmail.com*](images/beacon.png)

## First Party vs. Third Party Content

Content publishers typically include inline frames (IFrames) in their HTML templates. Iframes allow for an HTML document to be embedded in another HTML document. So within the main HTML document for the Globe and Mail homepage, for example, there could be several Iframes operating as placeholders for advertisements, which in turn trigger your browser to make additional GET requests for the content in those Iframes as well.

![*Ads being served in frames on theglobeandmail.com*](images/ss2.png)

In this scenario, the Globe and Mail is regarded as a "first party". It publishes content that it makes available at theglobeandmail.com, and you have voluntarily and specifically asked for the content at that address.

The parties involved in serving advertisements to each of the Iframes embedded in the Globe and Mail home page are typically referred to as "third parties". They are third parties in two senses:

1. You never specifically asked for the content they are providing. You asked for theglobeandmail.com, but you are getting this additional content thrown in because theglobeandmail.com has decided to allow others to inject content into its webpage and to serve you with terms of use that purport to acknowledge your consent to that activity.

2. The content that sits within these Iframes is not served from theglobeandmail.com at all; it's served from the advertising network that has paid for the opportunity to place content or advertisements within the Iframes at theglobeandmail.com.

Accordingly, when you go to theglobeandmail.com and you are served a template with space for ads, your browser then makes additional GET requests to the third party advertising networks' servers for the HTML, CSS, JavaScript or image files required to render the content within the Iframe. Your connection to that third party's server is direct: you directly asked for files from that server; but the party is a third party in the sense that its server was not the one you voluntarily requested files from.

Generally, when you visit theglobeandmail.com, a third party advertising network gathers as much information about you as it can, either from cookies or other bits of information that it has previously stored on your browser (more on that below) or from information contained in the request header. The third party advertising network then conducts an auction in which advertisers bid to have their advertisement published within the Iframe that the advertising network controls.[^An advertising network can receive up to 2 million bids per second. See Julia Angwin, "Zombie Cookie: The Tracking Cookie That You Can’t Kill", ProPublica, [https://www.propublica.org/article/zombie-cookie-the-tracking-cookie-that-you-cant-kill](https://www.propublica.org/article/zombie-cookie-the-tracking-cookie-that-you-cant-kill).] The more the advertising network knows about the visitor, the more advertisers are willing to pay to have their advertisement appear before the visitor. As a result, third party advertising networks are highly incentivized to learn as much about you as possible.

## HTTP Cookies and Online Behavioural Advertising ("OBA")

Cookies are small bits of text that are downloaded to your browser as you surf the web. Their purpose is to carry bits of useful information about your interaction with the website that sets them.[^The Guardian, "Tracking the trackers: What are cookies? An introduction to web tracking", Guardian, [https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/apr/23/cookies-and-web-tracking-intro](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/apr/23/cookies-and-web-tracking-intro).] Cookies are not software or computer programs; they are simply strings of text that sit in your browser that a website who set the cookie can access later.

![*Ad cookie from 3rd party ad network on theglobeandmail.com giving my browser a unique identifier*](images/ss3.png)

Cookies can be used for a variety of reasons, many of which may be benign. First parties typically use cookies:

- to help remember your preferences on a site (*e.g.* your language preference, or the last item in your shopping cart, etc.);
- to understand how you and other users are using the site
(*e.g.* for analytics purposes to determine the most popular content on the site, the most popular referrers, etc.); and
- for logging in to a service or to make sure you're logged in securely (*e.g.* these cookies may contain information such as your email address and your name – the information you gave when you signed up.)

Cookies are stored in the browser. This means that if you use a different computer, open a new web browser or delete your cookies, a website that uses cookies will treat you as if you have arrived for the first time and a new cookie will be set.

Just as first party content publishers can use cookies to record your preferences for your next site visit, third party advertising networks can set cookies in your browser that record the site you are currently viewing (and other information, discussed in more detail below). The following demonstrates how this process works:[^See Mike Nolet, "How do behavioral networks work?", Mike on Ads, [http://www.mikeonads.com/2007/02/28/how-do-behavioral-networks-work/](http://www.mikeonads.com/2007/02/28/how-do-behavioral-networks-work/).]

- Assume you visit 2 websites (*e.g.* travel.nytimes.com and macrumors.com) and each of these sites contains advertising placeholders that are used by the same third party advertising network (*e.g.* Google's [DoubleClick](https://www.doubleclickbygoogle.com/) ad network)
- When you visit the first site, travel.nytimes.com, an ad request goes to DoubleClick (*e.g.* GET http://ads.doubleclick.com/request?site=travel.nytimes.com) and the following sequence of events happen:
	- Browser requests content from DoubleClick
	- Server requests cookies (if any) from your browser that  have the DoubleClick domain address
	- Browser sends over any DoubleClick cookies it has
	- Server does some crunching, picks an ad
	- Server returns new cookie data & url to get the ad
	- Browser displays the ad
- The cookie coming back from DoubleClick's server is a DoubleClick cookie - it's not a nytimes cookie. Only DoubleClick can read this cookie. But crucially, DoubleClick will put in this cookie certain information, like the fact that you just came from travel.nytimes.com
- Each page you view that has a DoubleClick tracker in it thus gives DoubleClick more information about you, so if you visited travel.nytimes.com 4 times today to read articles about Cuba and then went to macrumors.com to find out the latest rumours about Apple iPads, DoubleClick would know this and have some idea that you are interested in Cuba and iPads
- So now when you visit macrumors.com, the following sequence of events happen:
	- Browser requests content from DoubleClick
	- Server requests cookies (if any)
	- Browser sends over cookies
		- Cookie shows you visited travel.nytimes.com 4 times today and were interested in articles about Cuba
	- Server does some crunching, picks an ad
		- Server plugs your user data (4 visits to travel sites re Cuba, 1 visit to tech site) into a "profile engine"
		- Profile engine returns categories, such as "travel and technology"
		- Server looks for ad campaigns targeted to these categories or holds an auction for advertisers to target this user, then picks the highest paying targeted campaign or highest bidder's ad
	- Server returns new cookie data and URL to get the ad
	- Browser shows the ad
- The end result is that you will be shown ads for travel or technology, possibly even targeted to Cuba as a destination or iPad purchases specifically

Accordingly, if two or more websites you visit include third party advertising from the same ad network, then the data they save as cookies can be shared across the sites, thus allowing the advertising network to learn more about you and your browsing habits as you move from site to site.

For example, Krux, a company recently acquired by Salesforce, supports more than 200 billion data collection events each month, interacting with more than 3 billion browsers and devices. Its tracking scripts are hosted on thousands of websites around the world.[^Flavio Negrini, "How Internet ads work, part 3: tracking users", Kasperski,  [https://blog.kaspersky.com/internet-ads-103/13569/](https://blog.kaspersky.com/internet-ads-103/13569/).] Vice.com and allrecipes.com are two independent websites that apparently don’t share users' information with each other, but both sites host Krux's scripts. If you visit those websites, even at different times, you'll see that the same keys are saved in your local storage by cdn.krxd.com, a Krux content delivery network ("**CDN**").

![*An example of a third party advertising network's tracking key being implemented on two different sites*](https://46qasb3uw5yn639ko4bz2ptr8u-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2016/12/localstorage-krux-1.jpg)

The largest third party advertising network trackers include Google, Facebook, Adobe and Microsoft, and they have greatly extended their reach and the share of websites that they span since 2006.[^B. Krishnamurthy, "Privacy leakage on the Internet", presented at IETF 77, March 2010, [http://ietf.org/proceedings/77/slides/plenaryt-5.pdf](http://ietf.org/proceedings/77/slides/plenaryt-5.pdf); B. Krishnamurthy and C. E. Wills, "Privacy diffusion on the web: A longitudinal perspective", in Proceedings of the 18th Conference on the World Wide Web, April 2009, [http://www.www2009.org/proceedings/pdf/p541.pdf](http://www.www2009.org/proceedings/pdf/p541.pdf).] Moreover, researchers have found that the number of trackers per page has been growing rapidly over the same period. Websites now frequently embed content from dozens of third parties.[^Jonathan R. Mayer and John C. Mitchell, "Third-Party Web Tracking: Policy and Technology", IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (2012), [https://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/files/publication/files/trackingsurvey12.pdf](https://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/files/publication/files/trackingsurvey12.pdf), p. 7.]

## Other Web Tracking Technologies

While the literature on web tracking tends to focus on HTTP cookies, there are myriad stateful ("**supercookie**") and stateless ("**fingerprinting**") technologies that can be used to pseudonymously correlate web activities.[^For the latest and most comprehensive research on modern web tracking methodologies, see Steven Englehardt and Arvin Narayanan, "Online Tracking: A 1-million-site Measurement and Analysis", presented at the Association for Computing Machinery Conference on Computer and Communications Security 2016, [https://webtransparency.cs.princeton.edu/webcensus/](https://webtransparency.cs.princeton.edu/webcensus/).] These methods of tracking are beginning to replace cookies as users have become more aware of cookies and implemented ad blocking features in their browsers.[^See Ray Kingman, "Canvas fingerprinting: Why ad tech’s latest shiny object is pure trouble", VentureBeat, [http://venturebeat.com/2014/08/22/canvas-fingerprinting-why-ad-techs-latest-shiny-object-is-pure-trouble/](http://venturebeat.com/2014/08/22/canvas-fingerprinting-why-ad-techs-latest-shiny-object-is-pure-trouble/); Judith Aquino, "Fingerprinting And Beyond: The Mobile Ad Targeting Trade-Off", AdExchanger, [https://adexchanger.com/data-exchanges/fingerprinting-and-beyond-the-mobile-ad-targeting-trade-off/](https://adexchanger.com/data-exchanges/fingerprinting-and-beyond-the-mobile-ad-targeting-trade-off/); Marciej Zawadzinski, "What is Device Fingerprinting and How Does it Work?", ClearCode, [http://clearcode.cc/2016/09/device-fingerprinting/](http://clearcode.cc/2016/09/device-fingerprinting/); Wendy Davis, "NAI Issues Privacy Guidelines For Digital Fingerprinting, Other Non-Cookie Ad Technology", MediaPost, [http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/250297/nai-issues-privacy-guidelines-for-digital-fingerpr.html](http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/250297/nai-issues-privacy-guidelines-for-digital-fingerpr.html); Wendy Davis, "Web Companies Now Track Visitors Based On Battery Life", MediaPost, [http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/281967/web-companies-now-track-visitors-based-on-battery.html](http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/281967/web-companies-now-track-visitors-based-on-battery.html).]

### Supercookies / Zombie Cookies

Because cookies can be deleted by users, and because users can choose to opt-out of receiving cookies, third party advertisers have developed new ways of persistently tracking your online activity that do not rely on cookies.

For example, with the advent of HTML5, developers can save data to local databases in your browser called SessionStorage or LocalStorage. Saving information in these two locations is helpful in the sense that it provides developers with a kind of caching mechanism. If information can be stored there, the next time you visit the same site the application does not need to make a request to the server before serving you the data; it can check to see if you already have the data in LocalStorage and, if so, use that data to render the page you have requested more quickly. SessionStorage makes data available for the current browser session, but everything is lost when the browser tab is closed. Data saved in LocalStorage, however, has no expiration date.  The information remains on your computer until you manually delete your browser's cache.

Researchers have documented instances whereby advertisers have used Flash storage and HTML5 LocalStorage to re-create or "re-spawn" your browsing activity even in the absence of cookies.[^M. Ayenson, D. J. Wambach, A. Soltani, N. Good, and C. J. Hoofnagle, "Flash Cookies and Privacy II: Now with HTML5 and ETag Respawning", July 2011, [https://fpf.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Flash%20Cookies%20and%20Privacy%20II%20Now%20with%20HTML5%20and%20ETag%20Respawning.pdf](https://fpf.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Flash%20Cookies%20and%20Privacy%20II%20Now%20with%20HTML5%20and%20ETag%20Respawning.pdf).] These techniques are commonly referred to as "zombie cookies" because they give the third party advertiser the ability to recreate tracking cookies even if you have deleted them.[^See generally, Sara Afzal, "Podcast: Why Tracking Is Scarier With Zombie Cookies", ProPublica, [https://www.propublica.org/podcast/item/podcast-why-tracking-is-scarier-with-zombie-cookies](https://www.propublica.org/podcast/item/podcast-why-tracking-is-scarier-with-zombie-cookies); Julia Angwin and Mike Tigas, "Zombie Cookie: The Tracking Cookie That You Can’t Kill", ProPublica, [https://www.propublica.org/article/zombie-cookie-the-tracking-cookie-that-you-cant-kill](https://www.propublica.org/article/zombie-cookie-the-tracking-cookie-that-you-cant-kill).]

Third party advertisers may also use information injected into an HTTP request header by an ISP or telecom carrier to identify you and re-spawn cookies.[^In industry jargon this is known as "header enrichment". See Julia Angwin and Jeff Larson, "Somebody’s Already Using Verizon’s ID to Track Users", ProPublica, [https://www.propublica.org/article/somebodys-already-using-verizons-id-to-track-users](https://www.propublica.org/article/somebodys-already-using-verizons-id-to-track-users).]

In 2015, for example, an online ad company called Turn used a hidden, undetectable UID produced by Verizon[^AT&T and Verizon both inserted tracking numbers into all web traffic that transmitted from a user's device in 2014. AT&T stopped the practice after users complained in November 2014, but Verizon continued to use the practice of injecting UIDs into traffic sent from phones to websites.] to monitor customers' web surfing on tablets and smartphones to recreate tracking cookies even after deletion.[^Sara Afzal, "Podcast: Why Tracking Is Scarier With Zombie Cookies", ProPublica, [https://www.propublica.org/podcast/item/podcast-why-tracking-is-scarier-with-zombie-cookies](https://www.propublica.org/podcast/item/podcast-why-tracking-is-scarier-with-zombie-cookies); Julia Angwin and Mike Tigas, "Zombie Cookie: The Tracking Cookie That You Can’t Kill", ProPublica, [https://www.propublica.org/article/zombie-cookie-the-tracking-cookie-that-you-cant-kill](https://www.propublica.org/article/zombie-cookie-the-tracking-cookie-that-you-cant-kill).] So if you went to travel.nytimes.com on your mobile phone or tablet, and there were advertisements being served by Turn, Turn would record your UID along with any other relevant cookie data in your first request. If you then deleted the cookie, but then went to another website using Turn to serve up ads, Turn would again receive your UID and then use that to look up any information it had associated with that UID previously. Turn would know that you went to travel.nytimes.com because it made a record of that and associated it to your UID. So although you tried to delete the cookie, it could still figure out who you are (or rather, your UID) and serve you targeted ads.

In 2016, Verizon ultimately entered into a settlement with the U.S. Federal Communications Commission ("**FCC**") for failing to make this kind of tracking opt-in rather than opt-out.[^Julia Angwin, "Verizon to Pay $1.35 Million to Settle Zombie Cookie Privacy Charges", ProPublica, [https://www.propublica.org/article/verizon-to-pay-1.35-million-to-settle-zombie-cookie-privacy-charges](https://www.propublica.org/article/verizon-to-pay-1.35-million-to-settle-zombie-cookie-privacy-charges).] The ad company, Turn, also signed a consent decree in 2016 with the Federal Trade Commission ("**FTC**") after the U.S. government alleged that the company made false representations to consumers. In the proposed settlement, Turn agreed to modify its privacy policy and to provide users an effective opt-out of tracking.[^Kate Kaye, "Digital Ad Firm Turn Settles With FTC in Super Cookie Case", AdAge, [http://adage.com/article/privacy-and-regulation/turn-settles-ftc-super-cookie-case/307245/](http://adage.com/article/privacy-and-regulation/turn-settles-ftc-super-cookie-case/307245/).] A class action was commenced against Turn in 2015 in which the plaintiffs alleged that Turn violated users' reasonable expectations of privacy by creating zombie cookies which monitored their behaviour surreptitiously and that users could not detect, delete or block. The suit was for violation of New York General Business Law section 349 for "deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any business, trade or commerce" and for trespass to chattels. In 2016, Turn filed a motion to stay the action and compel arbitration based on their status as a non-signatory to the agreements between the subscriber plaintiffs and their service provider, Verizon. The Court granted Turn's motion.[^*Henson v. Turn Inc.*, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 49138.]

In Canada, a similar program by Bell called the Relevant Ads Program ("**RAP**") was the subject of an investigation by the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada ("**OPC**"), the findings of which have also led to a $750 million class action.[^Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada, "Results of Commissioner Initiated Investigation into Bell’s Relevant Ads Program", OPC, [https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/opc-actions-and-decisions/investigations/investigations-into-businesses/2015/pipeda-2015-001/](https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/opc-actions-and-decisions/investigations/investigations-into-businesses/2015/pipeda-2015-001/); Christina Pellegrini, "Bell faces $750 million lawsuit over targeted ad program", Financial Post, [http://business.financialpost.com/fp-tech-desk/bell-canada-faces-750-million-lawsuit-over-tracking-of-cellphone-customer-internet-usage](http://business.financialpost.com/fp-tech-desk/bell-canada-faces-750-million-lawsuit-over-tracking-of-cellphone-customer-internet-usage).] This case is discussed in more detail in the [PIPEDA section](#pipeda) below.

### Fingerprinting

Another method of cookie-less tracking involves a website learning properties about the browser or client computer that, taken together, form a unique or nearly unique identifier. Some properties like CPU type, time zone, display settings and installed fonts, require active discovery through a script or plug-in. Other properties such as IP address, operating system, user agent, language and HTTP accept headers, can be passively learned from network traffic.[^Jonathan R. Mayer and John C. Mitchell, "Third-Party Web Tracking: Policy and Technology", IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (2012), [https://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/files/publication/files/trackingsurvey12.pdf](https://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/files/publication/files/trackingsurvey12.pdf), p. 9.]

For example, an analysis of network traffic on CBC.ca reveals that information regarding what the user is reading is being sent to a Toronto-based third party ad / analytics company, [Viafoura](http://viafoura.com/). If you set your Chrome browser to "Block third-party cookies and site data", this appears to have no effect. A cookie continues to be set by Viafoura, as shown in the screenshot below. Notice in particular that it's assigning the user a UniqueId as well as setting a DeviceID in the cookie. This is likely a sign of a zombie cookie / fingerprinting tactic at work:

![*Screenshot of a Viafoura cookie being set even though the user has blocked cookies in the browser settings. Shows cookie setting a DeviceId, using same UniqueId for the user as before on previous visits, and recording what the user is reading*](images/viafoura4.png)


In a 2010 sample of nearly 500,000 browsers, researchers reported that 83.6% were uniquely identified with a subset of active fingerprinting features. And while fingerprints change quickly, a simple matching algorithm was able to associate new and old fingerprints with over 99% precision.[^P. Eckersley, "How unique is your web browser?", presented at the Proceedings of the 2010 Privacy Enhancing Technologies Symposium, July 2010, DEFCON, [https://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-18/dc-18-presentations/Eckersley/DEFCON-18-Eckersley-Panopticlick.pdf](https://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-18/dc-18-presentations/Eckersley/DEFCON-18-Eckersley-Panopticlick.pdf); Jonathan R. Mayer and John C. Mitchell, "Third-Party Web Tracking: Policy and Technology", IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (2012), [https://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/files/publication/files/trackingsurvey12.pdf](https://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/files/publication/files/trackingsurvey12.pdf), p. 9.]

Researchers have also recently demonstrated how fingerprinting can be used to track visitors even when they use two or more different browsers.[^Dan Goodin, "Now sites can fingerprint you online even when you use multiple browsers", ArsTechnica, [https://arstechnica.com/security/2017/02/now-sites-can-fingerprint-you-online-even-when-you-use-multiple-browsers/](https://arstechnica.com/security/2017/02/now-sites-can-fingerprint-you-online-even-when-you-use-multiple-browsers/); Yinzhi Cao, Song Li and Erik Wijmans, "(Cross-)Browser Fingerprinting via OS and
Hardware Level Features", [http://yinzhicao.org/TrackingFree/crossbrowsertracking_NDSS17.pdf](http://yinzhicao.org/TrackingFree/crossbrowsertracking_NDSS17.pdf).] The new technique relies on JavaScript code that runs quickly in the background and instructs browsers to perform a variety of tasks. Those tasks, in turn, draw on operating-system and hardware resources—including graphics cards, multiple CPU cores, audio cards, and installed fonts—that are slightly different for each computer. In a test that collected 3,615 fingerprints from 1,903 users over a three-month period, the technique was able to successfully identify 99.2 percent of users. By contrast, older single-browser fingerprinting techniques, had a success rate of 90.8 percent.[^Dan Goodin, "Now sites can fingerprint you online even when you use multiple browsers", ArsTechnica, [https://arstechnica.com/security/2017/02/now-sites-can-fingerprint-you-online-even-when-you-use-multiple-browsers/](https://arstechnica.com/security/2017/02/now-sites-can-fingerprint-you-online-even-when-you-use-multiple-browsers/).]

Steven Englehardt and Arvin Narayanan's comprehensive 2016 research into online tracking shows that new HTML5 APIs such as the Battery Status API and the Audio API may also be abused by third parties for device fingerprinting.[^For the latest and most comprehensive research on modern web tracking methodologies, see Steven Englehardt and Arvin Narayanan, "Online Tracking: A 1-million-site Measurement and Analysis", presented at the Association for Computing Machinery Conference on Computer and Communications Security 2016, [https://webtransparency.cs.princeton.edu/webcensus/](https://webtransparency.cs.princeton.edu/webcensus/).] The authors find that existing privacy tools are not effective at detecting these newer and more obscure fingerprinting techniques.[^Steven Englehardt and Arvin Narayanan, "Online Tracking: A 1-million-site Measurement and Analysis", presented at the Association for Computing Machinery Conference on Computer and Communications Security 2016, [http://randomwalker.info/publications/OpenWPM_1_million_site_tracking_measurement.pdf](http://randomwalker.info/publications/OpenWPM_1_million_site_tracking_measurement.pdf) at p.1.]

The dilemma posed by these new fingerprinting techniques is that much of the modern web is engineered as JavaScript applications. As a result, simply disabling JavaScript in the browser is not an option for normal web browsing, as most organizations and services require it.

Several companies, including 41st Parameter/AdTruth, BlueCava, and iovation, advertise commercial browser fingerprinting technology.[^Jonathan R. Mayer and John C. Mitchell, "Third-Party Web Tracking: Policy and Technology", IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (2012), [https://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/files/publication/files/trackingsurvey12.pdf](https://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/files/publication/files/trackingsurvey12.pdf), p. 9.]

### The Mobile Connection

Christopher Parsons, a researcher at the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab, has recently explained the types of identifiers used by marketers to track users on their mobile devices.[^Christopher Parsons, "Privacy Tech-Know Blog: Uniquely You: The identifiers on our phones that are used to track us", OPC, [http://blog.priv.gc.ca/index.php/2016/12/08/privacy-tech-know-blog-uniquely-you-the-identifiers-on-our-phones-that-are-used-to-track-us/](http://blog.priv.gc.ca/index.php/2016/12/08/privacy-tech-know-blog-uniquely-you-the-identifiers-on-our-phones-that-are-used-to-track-us/).]

#### Hardware Identifiers

- *Media Access Control ("MAC") addresses*:  uniquely identifies a radio (Bluetooth / Wifi) on a device, is used in network communications and is rarely disclosed to anyone other than the network operator providing cellular or Wi-Fi service.
- *International Mobile Equipment Identifier ("IMEI")*: reveals where the device was manufactured and a unique serial number. The IMEI remains constant over the lifetime of the device and is used by cellular providers for a variety of purposes, such as checking if a device is ‘blacklisted’ from a network after being reported stolen. The IMEI number is also sometimes collected by application developers for user-tracking purposes.
- *The International Mobile Subscriber Identifier ("IMSI") and the Mobile Station International Subscriber Directory Number ("MSISDN")*: these numbers are included with the Subscriber Identity Module ("SIM") that customers insert into their phones or cellular-connected tablets. The MSISDN is the phone number that’s assigned to the mobile device. The IMSI, in contrast, includes a mobile country code and mobile network code used to identify the mobile network operator, and the identification number of the subscriber. When combined with the IMEI number, a network operator can ascertain when the device was made, the serial number of the device, version of its software, nation of usage-origin, carrier-of-origin, and the subscriber code of the carrier associated with the device. IMSIs are not typically transmitted by mobile carriers because of their potential use for long-term tracking purposes.
- *Internet Protocol ("IP") addresses*: assigned by cellular providers and local network operators (*e.g.* cafes) when mobile devices are configured to access the Internet. Such operators may also collect the MAC address information associated with either the cellular or Wi-Fi radios. These network operators can potentially monitor the activities that are undertaken on the network. Since they can observe all of the mobile device’s network traffic, these operators can correlate such activity with assigned IP addresses or, where login credentials are required, specific identifiers that may be more tightly linked with a specific individual or device owner.

#### Operating System Identifiers

- Google (Android) and Apple (iPhone) also include other identifiers in their operating systems. Google uses the Google Advertising ID and Android Identifier whereas Apple uses the IdentifierForAdvertising ("IDFA") Identifier.
- Google’s Advertising ID enables in-application targeted advertising and can be reset. Google and advertisers correlate activities with this ID in order to serve targeted advertising, and Google has a cross-device conversion system so advertisers can determine if a user viewed an ad on one device and then completed a sale on another. The Android Identifier, in contrast, is permanently associated with a device. It’s no longer supposed to be used by developers for advertising-related user tracking, though it can be used for non-advertising purposes to track user profiles.
- Apple’s IDFA is used to track users of applications in order to serve targeted advertisements and determine if the advertisement leads to a ‘conversion’, such as a sale or download of an advertised application. The IDFA can be reset and even disabled if users opt-out of ad-tracking.

#### Application Developer Identifiers

- Application developers can create their own identifiers and also access the identifiers provided by operating systems and manufacturers, including the IMEI, IDFA, Android identifier, and the phone number. Such unique identifiers can be used to provide them with requested services (such as letting them log into a fitness tracking application), and they can also be shared with third parties or sold to data brokers. Application developers may also collect users’ social media credentials or they can compel users to generate an application-specific credential set (*e.g.*, a username and password), and correlate these with identifiers.

Third party advertising companies can thus tap into a wide array of unique identifiers to pseudonymously track users both on and off-line. The Verizon / Turn case above provides an example of how these identifiers may be used to track users on mobile devices even if they have made efforts to prevent web tracking with cookies.

In the case of off-line tracking, Toronto-based [Turnstyle Solutions Inc.](https://getturnstyle.com/), for example, uses passive technology to sniff out the radio signals that are constantly broadcast by your phone and convert that data into analytics for brick and mortar retail shops. Turnstyle’s system is essentially a listening post: a customized Wi-Fi base station that listens in as smartphones broadcast their MAC addresses as they look for hotspots. The MAC address is then hashed into a unique identifier that can’t be traced to an individual, but can be used to determine if the same smartphone returns to a brick and mortar location for another visit. With this service, Turnstyle is able to tell a restaurant owner, for example, what its customers did before and after lunch.[^Shane Dingman, "Why your smartphone is telling this Toronto tech firm all about you", The Globe and Mail, [http://www.theglobeandmail.com/technology/tech-news/why-your-smartphone-is-telling-this-toronto-tech-firm-all-about-you/article16327257/](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/technology/tech-news/why-your-smartphone-is-telling-this-toronto-tech-firm-all-about-you/article16327257/); Armina Ligaya, "‘It’s creepy’: Location based marketing is following you, whether you like it or not", Financial Post, [http://business.financialpost.com/fp-tech-desk/personal-tech/its-creepy-location-based-marketing-is-following-you-whether-you-like-it-or-not?__lsa=71d0-6af5](http://business.financialpost.com/fp-tech-desk/personal-tech/its-creepy-location-based-marketing-is-following-you-whether-you-like-it-or-not?__lsa=71d0-6af5).]

### Cross-Device Tracking

Advertisers use two methods to establish user identity across devices: (1) deterministic and (2) probabilistic.

Deterministic matching taps into known user data to make a match, generally an email address used to log into multiple devices (*e.g.* Facebook, Google, Amazon, Twitter, AOL). Logging into Facebook or Google on your desktop and phone sends a signal to these companies that on both devices you are the same person. Any platform, or even publisher, that collects email addresses or asks users to sign in on their devices can use deterministic linking to target ads.[^Ricardo Bilton, "Cross-device tracking, explained", Digiday, [http://digiday.com/media/deterministic-vs-probabilistic-cross-device-tracking-explained-normals/](http://digiday.com/media/deterministic-vs-probabilistic-cross-device-tracking-explained-normals/); Allison Schiff, "2016 Edition: A Marketer’s Guide To Cross-Device Identity", AdExchanger, [https://adexchanger.com/data-exchanges/2016-edition-marketers-guide-cross-device-identity/](https://adexchanger.com/data-exchanges/2016-edition-marketers-guide-cross-device-identity/).]

The probabilistic approach draws on a variety of anonymized data signals like IP address, device type, browser type, location and operating system to create likely statistical connections between devices. Companies such as [Tapad](https://www.tapad.com/) and [Drawbridge](https://www.drawbridge.com/), for example, collect billions of data points, including IP addresses, browsing patterns and even device proximity — and then run predictive tests on them to figure out whether the devices belong to the same person. This method has a 97.3 percent chance of accurately identifying users across devices.[^Ricardo Bilton, "Cross-device tracking, explained", Digiday, [http://digiday.com/media/deterministic-vs-probabilistic-cross-device-tracking-explained-normals/](http://digiday.com/media/deterministic-vs-probabilistic-cross-device-tracking-explained-normals/); Allison Schiff, "2016 Edition: A Marketer’s Guide To Cross-Device Identity", AdExchanger, [https://adexchanger.com/data-exchanges/2016-edition-marketers-guide-cross-device-identity/](https://adexchanger.com/data-exchanges/2016-edition-marketers-guide-cross-device-identity/).]

In January 2017, the FTC released a report that describes the technology used to track consumers across multiple Internet-connected devices, the benefits and challenges associated with it, and industry efforts to address those challenges. The report concludes by making recommendations to industry about how to apply traditional principles like transparency, choice, and security to this relatively new practice.[^FTC, "FTC Releases New Report on Cross-Device Tracking", FTC, [https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2017/01/ftc-releases-new-report-cross-device-tracking](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2017/01/ftc-releases-new-report-cross-device-tracking); FTC, "Cross Device Tracking: An FTC Staff Report", FTC, [https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/reports/cross-device-tracking-federal-trade-commission-staff-report-january-2017/ftc_cross-device_tracking_report_1-23-17.pdf](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/reports/cross-device-tracking-federal-trade-commission-staff-report-january-2017/ftc_cross-device_tracking_report_1-23-17.pdf).]

Significantly, the FTC stated in its report that if the data that is being collected for purposes of cross-device tracking is "reasonably linkable" to a consumer **or a consumer's device**, it is personally identifiable:

> Another aspect of transparency is making truthful claims about the categories of data collected. Often, raw email addresses and usernames are personally identifiable, in that they include full names. Even hashed email addresses and usernames are persistent identifiers and can be vulnerable to reidentification in some cases. The Commission has repeatedly stated that data that is reasonably linkable to a consumer **or a consumer’s device** is personally identifiable. Therefore, consumer-facing companies that provide raw or hashed email addresses or usernames to cross-device tracking companies should refrain from referring to this data as anonymous or aggregate, and should be careful about making blanket statements to consumers stating that they do not share "personal information" with third parties.[^FTC, "Cross Device Tracking: An FTC Staff Report", FTC, [https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/reports/cross-device-tracking-federal-trade-commission-staff-report-january-2017/ftc_cross-device_tracking_report_1-23-17.pdf](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/reports/cross-device-tracking-federal-trade-commission-staff-report-january-2017/ftc_cross-device_tracking_report_1-23-17.pdf), pp. 12-13.]

Interestingly, Turnstyle (mentioned above) states that it collects 'anonymous' data notwithstanding the fact that the data it collects is linked to a UID that is just a hash of the phone's MAC address. By the FTC's standards (and as explained in more detail below, arguably the OPC's standards), this would be a persistent identifier that should not be referred to as 'anonymous'.


## The Privacy Implications of Third Party Web Tracking

Three privacy law implications arise from web tracking: (1) the volume and sensitivity of information available to third parties; (2) the potential for identification or re-identification of specific individuals with the data derived from web tracking; and (3) the lack of consumer awareness and consent to such practices.

### Information Available to Third Parties

While much of the web tracking that takes place online and across devices is anonymous or pseudonymous, in the sense that the tracker may not be able to identify the information as John Smith's specifically, web browsing history is inextricably linked to personal information. Jonathan Mayer - a lawyer and computer science Ph.D. graduate at Stanford who is known for exposing web tracking practices and is now a technologist at the FCC - has stated that the pages a user visits can reveal her location, interests, purchases, employment status, sexual orientation, financial challenges, medical conditions, and more. Examining individual page loads is often adequate to draw many conclusions about a user; analyzing patterns of activity allows yet more inferences.[^Jonathan R. Mayer and John C. Mitchell, "Third-Party Web Tracking: Policy and Technology", IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (2012), [https://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/files/publication/files/trackingsurvey12.pdf](https://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/files/publication/files/trackingsurvey12.pdf), p. 3.]

When a first party page embeds third party content, the third party website is ordinarily made aware of the URL of the first party page through an HTTP referrer or equivalent.[^W. Enck, P. Gilbert, B. Chun, L. P. Cox, J. Jung, P. Mc- Daniel, and A. N. Sheth, "TaintDroid: An information- flow tracking system for realtime privacy monitoring on smartphones", Proceedings of the 9th USENIX Symposium on Operating Systems Design and Implementation, October 2010, [http://www.enck.org/pubs/osdi10-enck.pdf](http://www.enck.org/pubs/osdi10-enck.pdf).] If the page embeds a script tag from a third party, the third party will also often learn the web page’s title from document.title. Some first parties will voluntarily transmit even more information.[^Jonathan R. Mayer and John C. Mitchell, "Third-Party Web Tracking: Policy and Technology", IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (2012), [https://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/files/publication/files/trackingsurvey12.pdf](https://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/files/publication/files/trackingsurvey12.pdf), p. 3.]

![*Screenshot of a Krux ad beacon on theglobeandmail.com with placeholders for tracking age, gender and zip/postal code*](images/kruxdemographics.png)

Collection of sensitive personal information has been documented in academic literature and by security and privacy professionals online.

In mid-2011, for example, it was discovered that an advertising network, Epic Marketplace, had publicly exposed its interest segment data, offering a rare glimpse of what third-party trackers seek to learn about users. User segments included menopause, getting pregnant, repairing bad credit, and debt relief.[^Jonathan Mayer, "Tracking the trackers: To catch a history thief.", The Center for Internet and Society, Stanford Law School, [http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/node/6695](http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/node/6695).]

Similarly, it was found that the free online dating website OkCupid was sending to the data provider Lotame how often a user drinks, smokes, and does drugs.[^Jonathan Mayer, "Tracking the trackers: Where everybody knows your username", The Center for Internet and Society, Stanford Law School, [http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/blog/2011/10/tracking-trackers-where-everybody-knows-your-username](http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/blog/2011/10/tracking-trackers-where-everybody-knows-your-username).]

### Identifiability and Re-Identifiability

It is well established at a theoretical, and increasingly empirical, level, that third party advertisers can use the so-called 'anonymous' or pseudonymous data collected via web tracking to not only limn a detailed portrait of a particular end-user, but also to identify the actual end user.

Arvid Narayanan, a computer scientist and Assistant Professor at Princeton University known for his work in the de-anonymization of data, has identified five ways in which a pseudonymous browsing history might become identified with an actual user:[^A. Narayanan. "There is no such thing as anonymous online tracking", The Center for Internet and Society, Stanford Law School, [http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/blog/2011/07/there-no-such-thing-anonymous-online-tracking](http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/blog/2011/07/there-no-such-thing-anonymous-online-tracking).]

1. **The third party is also a first party:** Facebook, for example, has over 800 million users and enforces a requirement that users provide their real name to the service. When a page includes a third-party Facebook social widget, Facebook identifies the user to personalize the widget.
2. **A first party sells the user’s identity:** Some first-party websites voluntarily provide ("leak") a user’s identity to third parties for pay.
3. **A first party unintentionally provides identity**: If a website puts identifying information in a URL or page title, it may unintentionally leak the information to third parties. In a 2011 study that examined signup and interaction with 120 popular sites for information leakage to third parties, for example, researchers reported that an aggregate of 48% leaked a user identifier in an HTTP Request-URI or referrer. Other examples of identity information leakage include:
	- Viewing a local ad on the Home Depot website sent the user’s first name and email address to 13 companies.
	- Entering the wrong password on the Wall Street Journal website sent the user’s email address to 7 companies.
	- Changing user settings on the video-sharing site Meta-Cafe sent first name, last name, birthday, email address, physical address, and phone numbers to 2 companies.
4. **The third party uses a security exploit:** A third party may exploit a cross-site security vulnerability on a first-party website to learn the user’s identity.
5. **Re-identification:** The third party could match pseudonymous browsing histories against identified datasets to re-identify them.

With respect to re-identification, in a recent study, researchers at Stanford and Princeton succeeded in identifying 72% of users by comparing their web-browsing history to publicly available information on social networks.[^Jessica Su, Sharad Goel, Ansh Shukla and Arvind Narayanan, "De-anonymizing Web Browsing Data with Social Networks", [http://randomwalker.info/publications/browsing-history-deanonymization.pdf](http://randomwalker.info/publications/browsing-history-deanonymization.pdf); Martin Andersen, "72% of ‘anonymous’ browsing history can be attached to the real user", [https://thestack.com/security/2017/02/07/72-of-anonymous-browsing-history-can-be-attached-to-the-real-user/](https://thestack.com/security/2017/02/07/72-of-anonymous-browsing-history-can-be-attached-to-the-real-user/).] Specifically, the researchers found that it was possible to reattach identities to 374 sets of apparently anonymous browsing histories to social media profiles on Twitter, Facebook, or Reddit accounts. They observed that most users subscribe to a distinctive set of other users on a social media service. Since users are more likely to click on links posted by accounts that they follow, these distinctive patterns persist in their browsing history. A third party can therefore de-anonymize a given browsing history by finding the social media profile whose "feed" shares the history’s idiosyncratic characteristics.[^See also "What does your browsing history say about you?", EDRI, [https://edri.org/what-does-your-browsing-history-say-about-you/](https://edri.org/what-does-your-browsing-history-say-about-you/).]


### Lack of User Knowledge and Consent

A final issue raised by web tracking concerns user knowledge, choice and consent. User choice in current online advertising self-regulation is implemented with opt-out cookies. There are several issues with this approach:

1. Users have to manually update their cookies and actually install new opt-out cookies to get the benefits of opt-out.
2. Cookies, including opt-out cookies, expire, requiring users to periodically renew opt-out cookies.
3. Users may clear their cookies, inadvertently removing their opt-out preferences.
4. Opt-out cookies are easy for a third party to improperly set or delete.
5. Opt-out cookies add additional roundtrips to the server, reducing website download speeds and performance.

In addition, opting out mechanisms either frequently don't work or the act of opting out of cookie tracking does not prevent advertisers from tracking you through other means such as JavaScripts or image beacons.

For example, when you navigate to theglobeandmail.com with an extension like Ghostery enabled, you learn that a Canadian third party advertiser named Eyereturn (owned by TorStar) is tracking you. If you go to Eyereturn's website and access its [privacy policy](http://eyereturnmarketing.com/privacy/), it tells you that if you have not yet opted-out of its collection of your information, you will see an opt-out button on the page. For a number of days, no such button appeared (this seems to be resolved now). Further, the privacy policy informs you that Eyereturn is a member of the Network Advertising Initiative ("**NAI**"), which also offers tools for opting-out of its members' tracking. When you navigate to [NAI's opt-out page](www.networkadvertising.org/choices/), you are informed that:

> Technology used to deliver interest-based advertising continues to evolve and change. As of the date of publication of this page, **this opt out covers interest-based advertising delivered to your device via HTTP cookies only. It does not cover the use of other technologies that NAI member companies may use to deliver interest-based advertising.**[^Network Advertising Initiative, "Consumer Opt-Out", NAI, [http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/#completed](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/#completed).]

Accordingly, even after opting out of tracking by NAI members like Eyereturn and Krux, tracking is still visible in the network stream of your browser through JavaScript scripts and beacons. The extent of the tracking is difficult to discern without further investigation, but in Krux's case, it appears that Krux is still creating a unique ID for each of its member sites you visit (so ID=1234 at theglobeandmail.com and ID=5678 at vice.com), logging your location, including latitude, longitude, postal code, ISP, and a number of other data points about your machine and browser.

![*Screenshot of a response that comes back from a Krux JavaScript tracker even though I have asked to opt-out through the NAI opt-out mechanism. It shows that Krux is tracking my location, postal code, ISP.*](images/kruxtracker.png)

![*Screenshot of Krux beacon. The various 5 digit codes beginning with the number 2 look like profile categorization tags.*](images/kruxbeacon.png)

Moreover, the actual opt-out mechanism is typically not made known to the end user unless he or she visits the website of the third party advertising network itself. For example, if you navigate to http://theglobeandmail.com, you will be given a link at the bottom of the page to the site's privacy policy. Importantly, trackers have already been placed in your browser before you have even navigated to the privacy policy where you allegedly 'consent' to the theglobeandmail's use of its own trackers and sharing of information with third party advertisers. In any event, a quick review of the privacy policy makes clear that it does not say anything about which third party advertisers it works with or the mechanisms available to you to opt-out of *their* cookies or web trackers. The relevant passage simply states:

## Consumer Opposition to Web Tracking and OBA

User surveys have consistently shown opposition to third parties collecting and using browsing activity.

- A 2009 representative U.S. phone survey by Turow et al. found that 87% of respondents would not want advertising based on tracking.[^J. Turow, J. King, C. J. Hoofnagle, A. Bleakley, and M. Hennessy, "Americans Reject Tailored Advertising and Three Activities that Enable It", SSRN, [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers2.cfm?abstract_id=1478214](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers2.cfm?abstract_id=1478214).]
- A December 2010 USA Today/Gallup poll reported 67% of respondents thought behavioral targeting should be outright illegal.[^Gallup, "Internet Ads", Gallup, [http://www.gallup.com/poll/145334/internet-ads-pdf.aspx](http://www.gallup.com/poll/145334/internet-ads-pdf.aspx).]
- In a mid-2011 representative U.S. online survey by TRUSTe and Harris Interactive, 85% of respondents said they would not consent to tracking for ad targeting, and 78% said they would not consent to tracking for website analytics.[^TRUSTe and Harris Interactive, "Privacy and Online Behavioural Advertising", Electronic Frontier Foundation, [https://www.eff.org/files/truste-2011-consumer-behavioral-advertising-survey-results.pdf](https://www.eff.org/files/truste-2011-consumer-behavioral-advertising-survey-results.pdf).]
- A 2012 representative telephone survey by Pew Research found that 68% of respondents were "not okay" with behavioral advertising.[^Kristen Purcell, Joanna Brenner and Lee Rainie. "Search engine use 2012", Pew Research Center, [http://www.pewinternet.org/2012/03/09/search-engine-use-2012/](http://www.pewinternet.org/2012/03/09/search-engine-use-2012/).]
- In its 2016 Survey of Canadians on Privacy, the OPC found that 86% of Canadian Internet users agreed that websites should ask for their consent before using information about their Internet browsing activities for targeted online advertising and seven in ten online Canadians (69%) said that targeted online ads make them feel like they have less privacy online.[^Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada, "2016 Survey of Canadians on Privacy", OPC, [https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/opc-actions-and-decisions/research/explore-privacy-research/2016/por_2016_12/?WT.ac=dpd-17&WT.ad=dpd-17](https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/opc-actions-and-decisions/research/explore-privacy-research/2016/por_2016_12/?WT.ac=dpd-17&WT.ad=dpd-17).]
- A recent IDC survey found 84% of U.S. consumers are concerned about the privacy of their personal information, with 70% saying their concern is greater today than it was a few years ago.[^Matt Hamblen, "Privacy worries are on the rise, new poll of U.S. consumers shows", ComputerWorld, [http://www.computerworld.com/article/3163207/data-privacy/privacy-worries-are-on-the-rise-new-poll-of-u-s-consumers-shows.html](http://www.computerworld.com/article/3163207/data-privacy/privacy-worries-are-on-the-rise-new-poll-of-u-s-consumers-shows.html).]
- A recent PageFair study also found that Ad blocker usage surged 30% in 2016.[^Lara O'Reilly, "Ad blocker usage is up 30% — and a popular method publishers use to thwart it isn't working", BusinessInsider, [http://www.businessinsider.com/pagefair-2017-ad-blocking-report-2017-1](http://www.businessinsider.com/pagefair-2017-ad-blocking-report-2017-1).]

# III. The Law

The following section provides an overview of the law and relevant causes of action that may attach to parties engaged in web tracking, looking first at statutory law and then the common law.

## Federal Statutes

The federal statutes engaged by web tracking practices of third party advertising networks are: PIPEDA and its modifications under the *Digital Privacy Act*,[^2015, c. 32, [http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/annualstatutes/2015_32/FullText.html](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/annualstatutes/2015_32/FullText.html).] CASL, and less directly, the *Competition Act*.
### PIPEDA

#### General Application

PIPEDA applies to organizations in the private sector that collect, use or disclose personal information in a commercial context. Personal information is defined as "information about an identifiable individual". Information is about an identifiable individual where there is a "serious possibility" that an individual could be identified through the use of that information, alone or in combination with other available information.[^Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada, "Guidelines on Privacy and Online Behavioural Advertising", OPC, [https://www.priv.gc.ca/media/2097/gl_ba_1112_e.pdf](https://www.priv.gc.ca/media/2097/gl_ba_1112_e.pdf), p. 1; Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada, "Policy Position on Online Behavioural Advertising", OPC, [https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/privacy-topics/advertising-and-marketing/behaviouraltargeted-advertising/bg_ba_1206/](https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/privacy-topics/advertising-and-marketing/behaviouraltargeted-advertising/bg_ba_1206/); *Gordon v. Canada (Health)*, 2008 FC 258 at para. 34.]

PIPEDA requires organizations that are subject to the Act to comply with the principles set out in Schedule 1.[^PIPEDA, s. 5(1).] These include principles of informed consent and limited collection of personal information.[^PIPEDA, Sch.1.]

PIPEDA may, and has been, applied extraterritorially to organizations outside of Canada where there exists a real and substantial link to Canada. For example, in the January 2017 decision of *A.T. v. Globe24h.com*,[^*A.T. v. Globe24h.com*, 2017 FC 114.] Justice Mosley of the Federal Court issued an order requiring the global removal of documents posted by a Romanian-based website that downloaded thousands of Canadian judicial and tribunal decisions, posted them online and demanded fees for their swift removal. On the issue of the extraterritorial application of PIPEDA, Mosley J. stated:

>   Section 4 of PIPEDA, the application provision for Part I, is silent with respect to the statute’s territorial reach. However, there is no language expressly limiting its application to Canada. In the absence of clear guidance from the statute, the Court can interpret it to apply in all circumstances in which there exists a "real and substantial link" to Canada, following the Supreme Court’s guidance in *Society of Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada v Canadian Assn. of Internet Providers*, 2004 SCC 427, [2004] 2 SCR 427 at paras 54-63 [*SOCAN*] and the other authorities cited therein.[^*A.T. v. Globe24h.com*, 2017 FC 114 at para. 50.]

After quoting extensively from Justice Binnie's judgment in *SOCAN*, Mosley J. continued:

> This Court has applied PIPEDA to a foreign-based organization where there was evidence of a sufficient connection between the organization’s activities and Canada: *Lawson v Accusearch Inc (cob Abika.com)*, 2007 FC 125 (CanLII), [2007] FCJ No 164 at paras 38-43 [*Lawson*]. The relevant connecting factors include (1) the location of the target audience of the website, (2) the source of the content on the website, (3) the location of the website operator, and (4) the location of the host server: *SOCAN*, above, at paras 59 and 61; see also *Lawson*, above, at para 41; *Davydiuk v Internet Archive Canada*, 2014 FC 944 (CanLII), [2014] FCJ No 1066 at paras 31-32 [*Davydiuk*]; *Desjean v Intermix Media, Inc*, 2006 FC 1395 (CanLII), [2006] FC 1395, [2007] 4 FCR 151 at para 42 [*Desjean*], aff’d 2007 FCA 365 (CanLII); *Equustek Solutions Inc v Google Inc*, 2015 BCCA 265 (CanLII), leave to appeal to the SCC granted [2015] SCCA No 355 [*Equustek*].

> In this case, the location of the website operator and host server is Romania. However, when an organization’s activities take place exclusively through a website, the physical location of the website operator or host server is not determinative because telecommunications occur "both here and there": *Libman v The Queen*, 1985 CanLII 51 (SCC), [1985] 2 SCR 178 at p 208 [*Libman*].

> In its submissions, the OPCC highlights three key connecting factors between the foreign-based website and Canada. First, the content that is at issue is Canadian court and tribunal decisions containing personal information which was copied by the respondent from Canadian legal websites. Second, the website directly targets Canadians by specifically advertising that it provides access to "Canadian Caselaw"/"Jurisprudence de Canada". The evidence is that the majority of visitors to Globe24h.com are from Canada. Third, the impact of the website is felt by members of the Canadian public. This is evidenced by the complaints received both by the OPCC and media reports of individuals suffering distress, embarrassment and reputational harm because of Globe24h.com republishing their personal information and making it accessible via search engines. The respondent is aware of these complaints.

> There is evidence that the Romanian authorities have acted to curtail the respondent’s activities and that they have cooperated with the OPCC investigation. Is that sufficient reason not to exercise the PIPEDA jurisdiction in this context? I think not. I accept the submission of the OPCC that the principle of comity is not offended where an activity takes place abroad but has unlawful consequences here: *Libman*, above, at p 209.

> [...]

> In the case at bar, since Romanian authorities have cooperated with the OPC investigation and taken action to curtail the respondent’s activities, the legitimate judicial acts of this Court will not be seen as offending the principle of comity. The respondent was fined for contravening Romanian data protection laws by, among other things, charging a fee for the removal of personal information from Globe24h.com. The respondent has appealed this fine to a Romanian court. Given the involvement of the Romanian counterpart to the OPCC, this Court’s findings would compliment rather than offend any action that may be taken in a Romanian court.[^*A.T. v. Globe24h.com*, 2017 FC 114 at paras. 53-56, 60.]

The case of *A.T. v. Globe24h.com* was not contested and the issue of the extent to which Canadian courts can issue global take down orders against foreign web service operators is currently before the Supreme Court of Canada in the case of *Google Inc. v. Equustek Solutions Inc., et al.*[^*Google Inc. v. Equustek Solutions Inc., et al.*, 2015 BCCA 265, leave to appeal granted, [2015] SCCA No 355.] However, there is nonetheless precedent that PIPEDA applies to organizations with a "real and substantial" connection to Canada. Accordingly, the statutory obligations under PIPEDA could be relevant for both Canadian third party advertisers and those operating outside of Canada.

#### Private Rights of Action

PIPEDA does not provide for a private right of action *per se*; it confers upon the Privacy Commissioner of Canada the power to receive all complaints pertaining to breaches of privacy in the private sector, to conduct investigations, issue reports on findings and file for Court hearings. Pursuant to s. 14(1), a complainant may: "**after receiving the Commissioner’s report or being notified under subsection 12.2(3) that the investigation of the complaint has been discontinued**, apply to the (Federal) Court for a hearing in respect of any matter in respect of which the complaint was made".[^PIPEDA, s. 14(1).] The Federal Court may award damages to the complainant, including damages for any humiliation that the complainant has suffered.[^PIPEDA, s. 16.]

PIPEDA's requirement that complaints go through the regulator first makes the statute an unsuitable vehicle for bringing a class action. The Commissioner's investigation may take time, and may arrive at unwelcome or erroneous conclusions that become unhelpful in any follow-on suit.

However, it may be possible to claim that a defendant, in breaching PIPEDA, has committed a wrong for which a class of plaintiffs should be compensated under restitutionary principles of waiver of tort. This is explained in the [waiver of tort analysis](#waiver-of-tort) in more detail below.

Moreover, some of the principles concerning the meaning of personal information and consent may be relevant to any action involving allegations of breach of privacy at common law, and thus warrant consideration.

#### Consent

Under PIPEDA, an organization may only collect, use or disclose personal information about an individual with consent of the individual, as authorized by law, or with deemed (implicit) consent as determined by statute.[^Michael Power, *The Law of Privacy*, LexisNexis, 2013, p. 71; PIPEDA, Sch. 1, Clause 4.3.]

PIPEDA requires that any consent provided must be an *informed* consent whereby the subject individual has knowledge of the collection, use or disclosure of personal information.[^Power, p. 72; PIPEDA, Sch. 1, Clause 4.3.] Consent is vitiated under PIPEDA if an organization provides false or misleading information with respect to collection, use or disclosure of information, or uses deceptive or misleading practices.[^Power, p. 72; PIPEDA, Sch. 1, Clause 4.4.2.]

The provision of consent requires the individual to be notified of the collection of personal information, orally or in writing, and of the purpose(s) for collection, as well as provided with contact details to allow the individual to ask questions about the collection.[^Power, p. 72; PIPEDA, Sch.1, Clause 4.2.] Implicit consent is not defined in PIPEDA; it's permitted where the information is "less sensitive" but "sensitive information" is not defined anywhere in the statute.[^Power, p. 73; PIPEDA, Sch. 1, Clause 4.3.6.]

The *Digital Privacy Act* (formerly known as Bill S-4) received Royal Assent in June 2015, resulting in a number of significant amendments to PIPEDA.[^Many amendments came into force upon Royal Assent, while those relating to giving notice of "breaches of security safeguards" (*i.e.* data breaches / hacking) will come into force following associated regulations being developed and  put into place by the Federal Government. These regulations are expected to be finalized this summer and will likely result in more class action activity in data breach cases where companies have failed to not only protect and secure data, but also give adequate notice of a breach to its users.] With respect to consent, the *Digital Privacy Act* modified the definition such that consent is now considered valid only if it is reasonable to expect that individuals *to whom an organization’s activities are directed* would understand the nature, purpose and consequences of the collection, use or disclosure, to which they are consenting. Accordingly, in the case of a website marketed at children, the test would be whether it is reasonable to expect those children to understand the nature, purpose and consequences of the collection, use or disclosure, to which they are consenting.

#### Guidelines on Privacy and Online Behavioural Advertising

There is no meaningful jurisprudence involving web tracking and OBA under PIPEDA.  However, the OPC has issued *Guidelines on Privacy and Online Behavioural Advertising* (the "**Guidelines**"), which acknowledge that while advertising may help subsidize the delivery of free online content, "it is essential that online advertising practices respect an individual’s privacy rights and consent choices".[^Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada, "Guidelines on Privacy and Online Behavioural Advertising", OPC, [https://www.priv.gc.ca/media/2097/gl_ba_1112_e.pdf](https://www.priv.gc.ca/media/2097/gl_ba_1112_e.pdf), p. 1.]

The Guidelines provide helpful support for the position that web tracking by third party advertisers engaged in OBA is a serious incursion on user privacy that requires clear, informed consent. Specifically, the Guidelines take the position that:

- Information involved in online tracking and targeting for the purpose of serving behaviourally targeted advertising to individuals will generally constitute personal information (as there will often be a serious possibility that the information could be linked to an individual).
- Whether opt-in or opt-out consent is required depends on the sensitivity of the information being collected.
- Opt-out consent *could* be considered reasonable, provided that:
	- individuals are made aware of the purposes for the practice in a manner that is clear and understandable;
	- the purposes are obvious and *not buried in a privacy policy*;
	- individuals are informed of these purposes *at or before the time of collection* and *provided with information about the various parties involved* in online behavioural advertising;
	- individuals are able to easily opt-out of the practice, ideally at or before the time the information is collected;
	- the opt-out takes effect immediately and is persistent; and
	- the information collected and used is limited, to the extent practicable, to non-sensitive information.
- Any collection or use of an individual’s web browsing activity must be done with that person’s knowledge and consent. Therefore, *if an individual is not able to decline the tracking and targeting using an opt-out mechanism because there is no viable possibility for them to exert control over the technology used, or if doing so renders a service unusable, then organizations should not be employing that type of technology for online behavioural advertising purposes*. This would include zombie cookies, super cookies and device fingerprinting.

As explained in the facts analysis in part II of this memo, most notices regarding the purposes of collection and trackers is in fact "buried in a privacy policy". Further, it is often not the case that a user of a website has access to the third party's privacy policy at the time of, or before, a tracker is embedded on their device, such that they could be "made aware of the purposes for the practice in a manner that is clear and understandable". Accordingly, the Guidelines suggest that opt-out consent is in many ways not reasonable when it comes to web tracking by third party advertisers for the purposes of OBA.

Further, the Guidelines make it clear that web tracking by third party advertisers is likely to be considered a violation of PIPEDA if the user is unable to decline tracking and targeting using an opt-out mechanism. As mentioned above, there is some evidence that some third party advertisers only permit opt-out of tracking by cookies but continue to collect information via other forms of JavaScript and beacon-based tracking. Further, in cases where advertisers are engaged in probabilistic cross-device tracking, Jonathan Mayer has suggested that a cross-device opt-out can only be done "with a likelihood, but no guarantee, that the opt-out will transfer to other devices."[^Allison Schiff, "The State Of Opt-Outs: Not Pretty For Privacy", [https://adexchanger.com/data-exchanges/the-state-of-opt-outs-not-pretty-for-privacy/](https://adexchanger.com/data-exchanges/the-state-of-opt-outs-not-pretty-for-privacy/).]

#### Policy Position on Online Behavioural Advertising

In December 2015, the OPC also released a *Policy Position on Online Behavioural Advertising* (the "**Policy Position**").[^Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada, "Policy Position on Online Behavioural Advertising", OPC, [https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/privacy-topics/advertising-and-marketing/behaviouraltargeted-advertising/bg_ba_1206/](https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/privacy-topics/advertising-and-marketing/behaviouraltargeted-advertising/bg_ba_1206/).] The Policy Position examines: (1) whether information collected by third party behavioural advertisers is personal information; (2) whether OBA can be an appropriate purpose for the collection, use and/or disclosure of personal information under PIPEDA; and (3) if so, what is the appropriate form of consent.

With respect to these issues, the Policy Position concludes as follows:

- Much of the information at issue in OBA – third-party tracking cookies, IP addresses, browser settings – may not be personal information in and of itself, in that, alone, it may say nothing about an identifiable individual. However, *when combined and used for the purpose of profiling a user in order to target advertisements to him or her based on inferred interests, the information can become information about an identifiable individual*.
- The OPC will generally consider information collected for the purpose of OBA to be personal information, given: the fact that the purpose behind collecting information is to create profiles of individuals that in turn permit the serving of targeted ads; the powerful means available for gathering and analyzing disparate bits of data and the serious possibility of identifying affected individuals; and the potentially highly personalized nature of the resulting advertising.
-  OBA may be considered an appropriate purpose for the collection, use and/or disclosure of personal information from the perspective of the reasonable person. However, OBA should not be considered a term or condition for individuals to use the Internet generally. There must also be meaningful consent, and there should be limitations on the types of information collected and used for profiling.
- Opt-out consent may be acceptable provided the conditions set out above in the Guidelines are met.
- Certain types of tracking that are used in OBA that an individual cannot stop or control without taking extraordinary measures (zombie cookies, super cookies, and device fingerprinting) should not be allowed at this time. Where a tracking technique offers no option for user control, and therefore no ability to consent or withdraw consent, and the technique is used to collect personal information for OBA purposes, the OPC’s position is that such tracking should not be undertaken because it cannot be done in compliance with PIPEDA.
- Children's personal information should not be tracked.

The Policy Position thus tracks the OPC's Guidance document, suggesting that the type of information collected via web tracking by third parties engaged in OBA is likely personal information, to which privacy protection under PIPEDA attaches. Further, such practices are likely contrary to PIPEDA where the third party has not obtained consent or has made it impossible, short of taking "extraordinary measures", for the user to stop certain tracking measures.

#### Results of Commissioner Initiated Investigation into Bell’s Relevant Ads Program

While there is no case law directly dealing with web tracking by third party advertisers under PIPEDA, the OPC's 2015 investigation of Bell's Relevant Ads Program ("**RAP**") provides a helpful analysis of the legality of web tracking for OBA purposes under PIPEDA.[^Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada, "Results of Commissioner Initiated Investigation into Bell’s Relevant Ads Program - PIPEDA Report of Findings #2015-001", OPC, [https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/opc-actions-and-decisions/investigations/investigations-into-businesses/2015/pipeda-2015-001/](https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/opc-actions-and-decisions/investigations/investigations-into-businesses/2015/pipeda-2015-001/).]

Beginning in August 2013, Bell announced via various delivery channels (including news releases, website posters, and email and text customer notifications) the launch of the RAP on November 16, 2013. Bell explained that it would begin using certain network usage information, such as web pages visited from a mobile device, as well as account/demographic information (e.g., postal code, gender, age range, and payment patterns) to serve Bell Customers targeted ads. Bell also identified the process by which Bell Customers could opt out of the RAP. Finally, Bell indicated that it would not share any personal information outside of the Bell Companies.

The RAP program consisted of three components:

- *Customer profiles*: Bell creates and maintains a Customer Profile for each Bell Customer of a Bell Service that is associated with the RAP, using network usage information and account/demographic information it already collects for various existing operational purposes. A Customer Profile includes demographic information and account information combined with network usage information, such as specific websites visited and apps used on a Bell Customer's mobile device. The Customer Profile also includes interests Bell has inferred from such network usage. For instance, a Customer Profile could indicate that a Bell Customer is an English-speaking female, between the ages of 26 and 30, in the city of Montreal, who has a medium to high interest in hockey and who recently visited www.cbc.ca/news.
- *Ad profiles*: RAP Advertisers create, via a special web interface, "Ad Profiles" that define the audience of Bell Customers to which they would like to deliver targeted ads (e.g., 26-30 year old males in the city of Ottawa with below average credit and an interest in hockey). Ad Profiles are comprised of a number of "dimensions", each corresponding to a specific type of information captured in Bell's Customer Profiles. Bell can limit the dimension selections available to any RAP Advertiser. Each Ad Profile is reviewed by Bell and approved prior to activation.
- *Profile matching and ad placement*: Bell sends a temporary customer ID and Customer Profile identification number to the RAP Advertiser, which in turn allows the advertiser to deliver a targeted ad to the Bell Customer whose Customer Profile matches an active Ad Profile.

The program worked like this: when a Bell Mobility customer browsed to a web site from her mobile phone, Bell would map that web site into two levels of interest categories. So if a user visited http://www.cbc.ca/sports, they would be assigned a Tier 1 interest category of "sports". If they then read an article about soccer, they would also be assigned a Tier 2 interest category of "soccer". Bell would give the interest categories to the third party advertisers while logging, for its own internal purposes, the URL the user actually visited.

Bell attempted to filter sensitive information. If a user visited a URL related to a certain type of cancer, this could yield interest categories of "Cancer" and "Men's Health". Bell would discard "Cancer", as a category it deemed to be sensitive, and assign the non-sensitive category, "Men's Health", to the Customer Profile.

The list of account / demographic dimensions that RAP Advertisers could specify in the creation of ad profiles included:

- Billing Address Location - city (or cities) and/or full or partial postal code(s);
- Age - age range(s) (*i.e.*, 18-25, 26-30, 31-35 ... 56-60);
- Gender - male, female, any, none;
- Primary Language - English, French, other;
- Credit Score - below average, average and/or above average;
- Average Revenue per User or "ARPU" (based on monthly billing amount) - very low, low, average, high and/or very high;
- Plan Type - post-paid and/or pre-paid; and
- Device Information - *e.g.*, mobile device manufacturer, model, device type, platform.

The OPC found that all account/demographic and network usage information collected and used by Bell for the purposes of the RAP was individual-level data linked to a specific Bell customer and therefore constituted personal information under PIPEDA.

Further, the OPC found that RAP went beyond the type of OBA contemplated in the Guidelines for which opt-out consent may be acceptable. The Guidelines describe OBA as "tracking consumers' online activities, across sites and over time in order to deliver advertisements targeted to their inferred interests". In contrast, Bell combined network usage information, including specific URLs visited, with extensive account information, including demographic information such as age, gender, average revenue per user, and postal code, for the purpose of serving targeted ads.

For Bell to have adequate consent for the RAP, the OPC held that Bell was required to obtain opt-in consent, ensure that Bell customers' choices to decline to participate in the RAP effectively ends the use of RAP advertising for profiling, and ensure that Bell customers' understanding of the RAP and their associated choices were supported by clear explanations outlining all RAP information.

The rationale for opt-in consent was based on the OPC's analysis of two factors: (1) the sensitivity of the information; and (2) the reasonable expectations of Bell's customers.

With regards to the sensitivity of the information, the OPC held:

> ... [T]he RAP involves the analysis of all URLs visited by a Bell Customer to assign interest categories. As such, certain of the URLs visited will inevitably be sensitive in nature as they will reveal an interest in sensitive issues. Principle 4.3.4 of Schedule 1 of the Act provides that certain information (for example, medical records and income records) is almost always considered to be sensitive. In our view, **URLs that relate to serious health conditions, sexual orientation,  financial condition, etc. would fall into this category.** Bell does have processes in place to ensure that URLs do not generate sensitive interest categories. However, as noted above, sensitive URLs may be used to generate non-sensitive interest categories regarding customers. ... **[T]he mere fact that sensitive URLs are used to generate non-sensitive interest categories does not change the fact that the underlying information being used is sensitive. Both the underlying information and the resulting categories that are derived from such information must be assessed in determining the sensitivity of the information at issue.**

With respect to the reasonable expectations of Bell's customers with regards to third party advertisements, the OPC held:

> Bell Customers may reasonably expect Bell to use certain account/demographic information for the limited purposes of marketing its own products and services, as it has for many years, **but the RAP involves the collection of much more information - including web browsing activity - to enable behaviourally targeted advertising by third parties**. Furthermore, while we found no evidence that Bell is disclosing personal information to RAP Advertisers, and while we are comfortable based on Bell's commitments (as outlined in paragraph 51) that it will be exercising due diligence to protect against unintended re-identification, including by means of contractual provisions, **the risk persists that advertisers could link Ad Profile information to an identifiable individual.**

The OPC's finding that the underlying URLs visited by users that related to serious health conditions, sexual orientation, financial condition, etc. constitutes sensitive information is relevant to any case against third party advertisers engaged in web tracking. While those advertisers may not have user-specific data such as name, address, billing information, etc., the OPC's position is that even at an anonymous level, the tracking of a user's browsing history can reveal sensitive information for which protection of privacy under PIPEDA attaches and for which it would be reasonable for a user to expect 'opt-in' consent. Given that users are not required to 'opt-in' to web tracking by third party advertisers, and given that URLs and often webpage titles are tracked by third party advertisers, it seems likely that the OPC would find such activity to be contrary to obligations under PIPEDA.

It should be noted that the OPC's investigation has resulted in a $750 million class action brought by Charney Lawyers and Sutts, Strosberg LLP.[^See [http://www.charneylawyers.com/Charney/bellprivacyclassaction.php](http://www.charneylawyers.com/Charney/bellprivacyclassaction.php).] The lawsuit seeks compensation for Bell's tracking of their customers' internet usage and creation of a customer profile database without the consent of their customers.[^**NTD: I have not been able to obtain a copy of the claim, but it is likely the primary cause of action is breach of privacy and breach of contract.**]

#### Conclusions re PIPEDA and its Application

PIPEDA is a poor vehicle for the commencement of a class action against third party advertisers engaged in web tracking. However, the OPC's Guidance, Position Paper and findings regarding Bell's RAP program help support two important propositions:

1. that the type of information collected by third party advertisers is sensitive information to which a right of privacy attaches; and
2. the methods by which third party advertisers currently seek consent to obtain and use that information is not adequate to sustain an argument that users have meaningfully consented to the collection of such information.

As explained in the [waiver of tort section](#waiver-of-tort) below, it may be possible to bring an action for waiver of tort on the basis that a third party advertiser has not complied with PIPEDA. There is to date no case law directly dealing with that issue and this specific statute, but it has been suggested in some cases that a violation of a statute may supply the wrong necessary to ground a claim for waiver of tort if it can be shown that the legislators intended to depart from the general rule that statutory rights are enforced by statutory remedies.[^See the cases in the [waiver of tort](#waiver-of-tort) section.]

### Canada's Anti-Spam Legislation

The second federal statute relevant to the issue of web tracking by third party advertisers is CASL.

#### Private Rights of Action

As of July 1, 2017, individuals and organizations will be entitled to institute a "private right of action" before the courts against those that contravene certain provisions of CASL.[^*CASL*, at ss. 47 to 51, 55.]

A person may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction (the Federal Court or a superior court of a province) for a compensation order where the person alleges that they are affected by an act or omission:

- that constitutes a contravention under sections 6 to 9 of CASL, *i.e.*, the reception of unsolicited commercial electronic messages, the alteration of transmission data, or the installation of a computer program;
- that is reviewable under section 74.011 of the *Competition Act*, *i.e.* false or misleading electronic messages within the meaning of amendments to the Competition Act; or
- that relates to a violation of the email harvesting and use provisions in sections 7.1(2) and (3) of PIPEDA.

The court may order compensation equal to the amount of loss or damages suffered and expenses incurred ("compensatory damages"), in addition to $200 for each contravention, up to a maximum of $1,000,000 per day of contravention ("non-compensatory damages").[^*CASL*, ss. 51(1) CASL.]

Unless the court decides otherwise, the private right of action must be brought no later than three years after the day on which the contravention or reviewable conduct became known to the applicant.[^*CASL*, s. 47(2).]

Sections 47 to 51 and 55 of CASL do not expressly include or exclude the possibility of bringing claims as class actions. However, pursuant to section 48, the court may not consider an application for an order against a person under CASL if:

- (a) the person has entered into an undertaking under subsection 21(1), or has been served with a notice of violation under subsection 22(1), in connection with the act or omission referred to in the application; or
- (b) the person is liable for the contravention by virtue of section 52 or 53 and the corporation, employee, agent or mandatary, as the case may be, who committed the contravention has entered into an undertaking under subsection 21(1), or has been served with a notice of violation under subsection 22(1), in connection with the act or omission referred to in the application.

Accordingly, any claim commenced under the private right of action in CASL could be extinguished if the defendant enters into an undertaking with the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission ("**CRTC**").

#### Application of CASL to Web Tracking by Third Party Advertisers

Web tracking does not easily fit within the provisions in CASL that prohibit the sending of commercial electronic messages.[^CASL defines a commercial electronic message as an "electronic message that, having regard to the content of the message, the hyperlinks in the message to content on a website or other database, or the contact information contained in the message, it would be reasonable to conclude has as its purpose, or one of its purposes, to encourage participation in a commercial activity". Cookies and other tracking code used by third party advertisers do not appear to be captured by this definition and, in fact, are expressly mentioned as types of "computer programs" rather than commercial electronic messages.] However, CASL also has a malware-related provision that prohibits a person from, in the course of a commercial activity, installing or causing to be installed "a computer program on any other person’s computer system or, having so installed or caused to be installed a computer program, cause an electronic message to be sent from that computer system, unless" the person has obtained "the express consent of the owner or an authorized user of the computer system and complies with subsection 11(5) (the withdrawal of consent provision)".[^*CASL*, s. 8(1).]

Whether web tracking code would be caught by this provision is very unclear from the wording of the statute. The statute provides that a "computer program" shall have the same meaning as that in section 342.1 of the *Criminal Code*: "computer data representing instructions or statements that, when executed in a computer system, causes the computer system to perform a function".[^*Criminal Code*, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46, s. 342.1.] A cookie, being merely a snippet of text that does not get executed, would likely not fall under this definition, but JavaScript code could arguably qualify.

However, CASL provides that a person is considered to "expressly consent to the installation of a computer program" if:

> (a) the program is

>> (i) a cookie,

>> (ii) HTML code,

>> (iii) Java Scripts,

>> (iv) an operating system,

>> (v) any other program that is executable only through the use of another computer program whose installation or use the person has previously expressly consented to, or

>> (vi) any other program specified in the regulations; **and**

> (b) the person’s conduct is such that it is reasonable to believe that they consent to the program’s installation.

The implication here is that a cookie or JavaScript code is in fact a kind of computer program for the purposes of the CASL. If not, it would not be necessary to specify these items as computer programs in this provision. However, as computer programs, they are of a type to which there is deemed express consent, unless it can be shown that it is *not* reasonable to believe that the user consented to the program’s installation.

It could be argued that the second condition required for deemed explicit consent is not met in the case of third party web tracking, particularly where fingerprinting techniques are being used. For example, the Globe and Mail's privacy policy provides, in part:

> Like most websites, The Globe relies on cookies and other commonly used technologies such as JavaScript, Adobe Flash, web beacons and pixels to provide website functionality and to deliver the best experience for our users. We use these technologies to collect information about the usage of our site and to offer users advertising that is relevant to them based on how they use the site. **By using The Globe website, you give us and trusted third parties on our website consent to collect Usage Information using cookies and similar technologies and to use it for the purposes specified below.**

At no time are the third parties identified and at no time are links to their privacy policies given. Nor are the details of how the information is collected by those third parties provided in the first party privacy policy. In the absence of such details, which are mentioned in the other provisions dealing with express consent, it may be argued that it is not reasonable to believe that a user consented to the installation of a third party tracking program. This would be especially true in the case where a user attempted to opt-out of web tracking by a particular advertiser only to find JavaScript code still running in the browser for the purposes of tracking (as in the Viafoura example mentioned above).

#### Conclusions re CASL and its Application

CASL's provisions regarding malware are likely to be helpful in any claim against third party advertisers engaged in web tracking as, unlike the causes of action relating to invasions of privacy, there are no requirements concerning the sensitivity of the information or the offensive of the intrusion. CASL establishes a kind of strict liability for installing malware on a user's machine, subject to a test in the case of JavaScripts and cookies regarding the reasonableness of inferring that a user consented to the installation. Given that many third parties provide no notice of their terms of service or privacy policies on first party websites, there appears to be strong grounds to challenge the conventional wisdom that users have consented to the installation of web tracking programs on their browser by third party advertisers. A more detailed discussion of the law of consent in this area is set out below with respect to the common law.

### The Competition Act

Assuming a scenario wherein a third party advertiser has misrepresented its practices under its privacy policy, including in particular the effectiveness of its opt-out policy, a cause of action under the *Competition Act* for false or misleading representations may also be applicable.

Section 74.01(1)(a) provides that a person "engages in reviewable conduct who, for the purpose of promoting, directly or indirectly, the supply or use of a product or for the purpose of promoting, directly or indirectly, any business interest, by any means whatever, makes a representation to the public that is false or misleading in a material respect".

Section 36(1)(a) provides that any person who has suffered loss or damage as a result of conduct that is contrary to any provision of Part VI, which includes s. 74.01(1)(a), may, in any court of competent jurisdiction, sue for and recover from the person who engaged in the conduct an amount equal to the loss or damage proved to have been suffered by him, together with any additional amount that the court may allow not exceeding the full cost to him of any investigation in connection with the matter and of proceedings under this section.

The *Competition Act* provides a more limiting cause of action, limiting damages to an amount equal to the loss or damage proved to have been suffered by the claimant. With web tracking, there is typically little or no loss or damage suffered by the user. However, as explained in more detail below, it may be possible to bring a claim in waiver of tort for breach of the *Competition Act*.

Further investigation into the applicability of this cause of action, including its potential as a basis for a claim in waiver of tort, can be done later if and when facts arise suggesting a third party advertiser has misrepresented its terms and privacy policy.

## Provincial Statutes

### Provincial Privacy Acts

#### General Principles

A statutory tort / cause of action related to individual privacy exists in four Canadian common law provinces: British Columbia,[^*Privacy Act*, RSBC 1996, c 373 [*BC Privacy Act*].] Manitoba,[^*The Privacy Act*, CCSM, c P125, [*Manitoba Privacy Act*].] Newfoundland and Labrador,[^*Privacy Act*, RSNL 1990, c P-22, [*Newfoundland Privacy Act*].] and Saskatchewan.[^*The Privacy Act*, RSS 1978, c P-24 [*Saskatchewan Privacy Act*].]

In these four provinces, an individual has a valid cause of action against any person who violates his or her right to privacy even if no real damages can be proven.[^*BC Privacy Act*, s. 1; *Manitoba Privacy Act*, s. 2(2); *Newfoundland Privacy Act*, s. 3(1); *Saskatchewan Privacy Act*, s. 2.] The "right to privacy" is not defined in the Acts, however, each Act provides examples of the kind of conduct that would constitute a *prima facie* violation of the right to privacy. These include eavesdropping or surveillance, whether or not accomplished by trespass.[^See *e.g.* *B.C. Privacy Act*, s. 1(4) and *Saskatchewan Privacy Act*, s. 3.]

With the exception of Manitoba, a statutory violation of privacy occurs when a person without a claim of right wilfully violates the privacy of another.[^Power, p. 193.] The test for breach of privacy is similar in Manitoba, but adds an additional requirement that the violation be substantial and unreasonable.[^*Manitoba Privacy Act*, s. 2(1).]

The British Columbia Court of Appeal recently held that the statutory tort for breach of privacy under its *Privacy Act* ousts any common law claim for breach of privacy at common law.[^*Ari v. Insurance Corporation of British Columbia*, 2015 BCCA 468 at para. 9.] Accordingly, in these jurisdictions, a claim for breach of privacy would likely have to be made under the statutorily defined tort.

A claim of violation of a statutory right of privacy must contain allegations so that, at a minimum, the following is clear:

- the action is pursuant to the Act;
- there is an act or actions which are claimed to be a violation of privacy which comes within the arguable scope of the Act;
- the privacy is that of a person;
- the type of privacy interest violated is generally identifiable; and
- the violation is wilful and without claim of right.[^Power, pp. 193-194; *Bigstone v. St. Pierre*, 2011 SKCA 34 at para. 34.]

The "claim of right" requirement is key for any claim to succeed under the statutory invasion of privacy torts and requires the defendant to have "an honest belief in a state of facts, which, if it existed, would be a legal justification or excuse".[^Power, p. 195; *Hollingsworth v. BCTV*, [1998] B.C.J. No. 2451 (B.C.S.C.), 113 BCAC 304 (C.A.).]

The "wilfulness" requirement requires that the defendant have an intention to do an act which it knew or should have known would violate the privacy of another[^Power, p. 195; *Hollingsworth v. BCTV*, [1998] B.C.J. No. 2451, 113 BCAC 304 (C.A.).] and which is done purposely without a justifiable excuse.[^Power, p. 195; *Davis v. McArthur*, [1969] B.C.J. No. 249, 10 D.L.R. (3d) 250 at 253 (B.C.S.C.).]

Consent is a defence under the four statutes. Where the plaintiff consented to the act or conduct in question, there can be no invasion of privacy.

#### Judicial Consideration of the Privacy Acts

The jurisprudence under these statutes is not particularly helpful in determining how a court might decide a claim for breach of privacy against third party advertisers engaged in web tracking. The following cases provide some sense of how courts have interpreted the requirements in previous cases.

In *Ladas v. Apple Inc.*,[^*Ladas v. Apple Inc.*, 2014 BCSC 1821.] the plaintiff commenced a class action against Apple alleging that Apple designed and produced iOS4 so as to record and store locational data on iDevices in unencrypted form, for long periods of time, and to copy the unencrypted data onto computers when iDevices were being synchronized. The plaintiff argued that, as a result, her privacy, and the privacy of proposed class members, had been breached. In addition, she argued that Apple’s conduct constituted a deceptive act or practice under the *Business Practices and Consumer Protection Act*, S.B.C. 2004, c. 2 (the "**BPCPA**").  

The Court held that the plaintiff's claims under the *Privacy Act* disclosed a reasonable cause of action notwithstanding the fact that the pleading did not assert that data had been transmitted to Apple or that Apple or anyone else had accessed the plaintiff's data, but she did not plead a reasonable claim under the BPCPA. The Court nonetheless refused to certify the action because the claim did not satisfy the identifiable class and common issues requirements of the *Class Proceedings Act*. Specifically, the Court found that only B.C. residents could claim under the *B.C. Privacy Act* and, given s. 1(2), which provides, "The nature and degree of privacy to which a person is entitled in a situation or in relation to a matter is that which is reasonable in the circumstances, giving due regard to the lawful interests of others". Resolution of that claim required the Court to look not only at Apple, but also at the individual circumstances of the plaintiff and other proposed class members.

In *Douez v. Facebook Inc.*[^*Douez v. Facebook Inc.*, 2014 BCSC 953, rev'd 2015 BCCA 279, leave to appeal granted, [2015] S.C.C.A. No. 367.], the B.C. courts addressed issues of jurisdiction and consent under the *B.C. Privacy Act*. The case is a class action that was commenced against Facebook in B.C. with respect to its "sponsored stories" feature. The representative plaintiff alleged that her name and portrait were featured in sponsored stories (showing that she liked a particular story) without her consent. She commenced an action in the B.C. Supreme Court, relying on s. 3(2) of the *Privacy Act*, which provides:

> It is a tort, actionable without proof of damage, for a person to use the name or portrait of another for the purpose of advertising or promoting the sale of, or other trading in, property or services, unless that other, or a person entitled to consent on his or her behalf, consents to the use for that purpose.

Facebook argued that the court should decline to exercise its jurisdiction, as the Terms of Use required the dispute to be heard in California and B.C. was *forum non conveniens*. The chambers judge held that the *Privacy Act* evinced a legislative intention to override any such terms and that the matter must be heard in B.C. Facebook appealed and the B.C. Court of Appeal overturned the chambers judge on this issue. The matter is now before the Supreme Court of Canada.

At the certification hearing, however, Facebook argued that the requirement of a lack of consent is a critical element of the *Privacy Act* which defeats certification, as it makes it impossible to have a suitable class definition. The chambers judge disagreed, holding that it was appropriate for the proposed class definition not to address the element of lack of consent, as that could be addressed as a common issue at the merits trial. Interestingly, the chambers judge cast doubt on whether it was even the plaintiff's obligation to prove a lack of consent, or whether it was Facebook's obligation to prove consent:

> There is one further point to address in relation to the Facebook argument.  Facebook argues that the onus of proving a lack of consent will be on the plaintiff and class members as a necessary element of the Privacy Act tort.  I am not so sure.  Facebook has no authority to support this position, other than its own interpretation of the Privacy Act.

> It may well be that the onus of proving an appropriation of personality will be on the plaintiff, but one possible interpretation of the Privacy Act is that the onus will then shift to the defendant to affirmatively prove consent as a defence.  Who has the onus of either proving a negative (a lack of consent) or an affirmative (consent) does not need to be decided on the present application.[^*Douez v. Facebook Inc.*, 2014 BCSC 953 at paras. 197-198.]

The meaning of consent under the *Privacy Act*, as well as who has the burden to demonstrate consent or a lack of consent, is thus not clear and has not been considered in any meaningful way with respect to terms of use and privacy policies in the existing case law.

In *Bigstone v. St. Pierre*,[^*Bigstone v. St. Pierre*, 2011 SKCA 34.] the plaintiff sued the defendant in tort pursuant to s. 2 of the Saskatchewan *Privacy Act*, alleging that the defendant violated his privacy when she used her position as a customer service representative at Saskatchewan Power Corporation to confirm a fact relevant to her lawsuit against the plaintiff in another action. The issue on appeal was whether it was plain and obvious that the plaintiff's claim disclosed no reasonable cause of action. The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal held that it was not and dismissed the appeals. In doing so, the Court of Appeal had occasion to consider the meaning of privacy under the Saskatchewan *Privacy Act*. The Court noted:

> To date the Act has received very little judicial consideration in Saskatchewan and what information is private under the Act and what are the essential elements of the statutory tort have yet to be fully defined by our courts. There has been no consideration of the Act by this Court.[^*Bigstone v. St. Pierre*, 2011 SKCA 34 at para. 19.]

The Court then went on to observe:

> Apart from the Act, the development of the concept and categories of privacy interests has been largely driven by *Charter* cases. The generally accepted categories include personal, territorial and informational privacy: *R. v. Tessling*, 2004 SCC 67 (CanLII), [2004] 3 S.C.R. 432.  The Supreme Court of Canada, in *R. v. Duarte*, 1990 CanLII 150 (SCC), [1990] 1 S.C.R. 30 at p. 46, stated that informational privacy: [M]ay be defined as the right of the individual to determine when, how, and to what extent he or she will release personal information.

> In *Charter* analyses, the extent to which the state can infringe these interests is defined in part by the concept of reasonable expectation of privacy. As an initial observation, the Act does not appear to be designed, like ss. 7 and 8 of the Charter, as a shield to limit state infringement of privacy, but rather a sword to allow compensation for infringement of privacy. **This suggests that the privacy the Act protects may be more extensive, and different in some respects, than privacy under the Charter. The analytical approach to whether an expectation of privacy exists and is breached in a particular case may be different than the approach into Charter cases.**

> [...]

> Section 2 does not define privacy but we know from the preamble to s. 3, which reads "without limiting the generality of section 2", that the concept is arguably quite broad. Section 3 gives examples not of the types of privacy but of prohibited acts which infringe privacy. Generally speaking the examples all have the salient features of "attention to", "intrusion into" or "interference with" found in the general definition of privacy referred to above.  From the examples set forth in s. 3, some of the kinds of privacy protected by the *Act* can be inferred and generally speaking, they would arguably be the same kinds enunciated in *Tessling*. However, none of the categories of the examples of prohibited acts speak to necessarily compromising a biographical core of personal information or intimate details of the lifestyle and personal choices of individuals although the prohibited acts can certainly do so in a particular case.  Rather, the listed categories speak of a privacy interest that is both more broad and less intimate than the *Charter* concepts, which would, for example, not prohibit surveillance in a public place under most circumstances.[^Bigstone v. St. Pierre*, 2011 SKCA 34 at paras. 20-21, 23.]

Accordingly, the limited case law available defining the meaning of privacy under the provincial *Privacy Acts* suggests that it should be defined broadly and not narrowly limited to *Charter* concepts of core biographical information.

Each Act provides, however, that "The nature and degree of privacy to which a person is entitled in any situation or in relation to any situation or matter is that which is reasonable in the circumstances, due regard being given to the lawful interests of others." In this way, the test under the provincial *Privacy Acts* is similar to the test for intrusion upon seclusion at common law, where courts have stated that only intrusions that a reasonable person would regard as "highly offensive" will be considered actionable.

#### Conclusions re Provincial Privacy Acts and their Application

The torts for breach of privacy under the provincial *Privacy Acts* are similar to the common law tort of intrusion upon seclusion in Ontario in that they require evidence of "wilful" or intentional conduct and the nature and degree of the plaintiff's privacy entitlement is circumscribed by what is "reasonable in the circumstances".

The primary tactical advantages that can be gained with claims under the provincial *Privacy Acts* are:

1. **Consent:** It may be argued on the basis of *Douez* that consent is a defence, and that the defendant third party advertiser has the burden of proving that an end user consented to web tracking by agreeing to its terms of service or privacy policies. If this were the case, an action under the provincial *Privacy Acts* might confer a tactical advantage, as a plaintiff would not be required to prove a lack of consent.
2. **Jurisdiction:** It may also be argued on the basis of *Douez* that the requirement under the B.C. *Privacy Act* that an action under the Act must be heard and determined by the Supreme Court of B.C. gives B.C. jurisdiction over foreign companies such as Facebook. The B.C. Court of Appeal disagreed with this conclusion but the issue remains on reserve with the Supreme Court of Canada.
3. **Explicit Recognition of Surveillance as Breach of Privacy:** Web tracking is all about surveillance. Given that the *Privacy Acts* specifically identify surveillance as actionable conduct constituting an invasion of privacy, it may be easier to bring a successful claim under these statutory torts.
3. **Less Than Highly Offensive Standard:** The requirement that the nature and degree of the plaintiff's privacy entitlement be circumscribed by what is "reasonable in the circumstances" could arguably be understood as something less than the "highly offensive" test for intrusions upon seclusion at common law. If so, this could also make claims under the provincial *Privacy Acts* less onerous to meet on a trial of the merits.

In the absence of any definition of what constitutes an invasion of privacy, however, the courts in provinces with a statutory tort are left with more or less the same task as courts in provinces without such statutes.[^*Jones v. Tsige*, 2012 ONCA 32 at paras. 52-54.]

### Quebec Privacy Laws

Under Quebec law, the right to privacy is explicitly protected both by arts. 3 and 35-37 of the *Civil Code of Quebec* and by s. 5 of the *Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms*, R.S.Q. c. C-12.[^See *Robbins v. Canadian Broadcasting Corp.* (1957), 12 D.L.R. (2d) 35 (C.S. Que.); *Aubry c. Éditions Vice Versa Inc.*, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 591 (S.C.C.); H. Patrick Glenn "The Right to Privacy in Quebec Law" in Aspects of Privacy Law: Essays in Honour of John M. Sharp, Dale Gibson ed. (Toronto: Butterworths, 1980) at ch. 3.]

In particular, Quebec's *Civil Code* states that no one may invade another's privacy without consent and provides a non-exhaustive list of acts constituting invasions of privacy, which include:

- entering or taking anything in a person's home or intentionally intercepting or using private communications;
- appropriating or using a person's image or voice while he or she is in private premises;
- keeping a person's private life under surveillance by any means;
- using a person's name, image, likeness or voice for a purpose other than the legitimate information of the public; and
- using a person's correspondence, manuscripts or other personal documents.[^Power, p. 202.]

Web tracking is arguably a means of surveillance and, to the extent the web tracking code has access to one's browsing history, could arguably qualify as using person's personal documents as well.

[**NTD: Research on this area of law is best left to someone who can read and speak French and has greater familiarity with Quebec Civil Law**]

### Consumer Protection Act

The *Consumer Protection Act* in Ontario, and similar legislation in other provinces, provides for class proceedings in cases where a person engages in "unfair practices", which include making a false, misleading or deceptive representation.[^*Consumer Protection Act, 2002*, S.O. 2002, c. 30, Sched. A.]

In the case of web tracking by third party advertisers, it would be difficult to argue that the CPA applies. A "consumer agreement" is a key requirement of any action under the CPA, and the definition of a "consumer agreement" requires that the "supplier" agree to supply goods or services for "payment". In the case of web tracking by third party advertisers, the end user never enters into an agreement with the advertiser for the supply of goods or services for payment.

## Common Law Causes of Action

The following section explains the common law causes of action that may be relevant to a claim against third party advertisers engaged in web tracking.

### Intrusion Upon Seclusion

#### The Law in *Jones v. Tsige*

In its 2012 decision in *Jones v. Tsige*,[^*Jones v. Tsige*, 2012 ONCA 32.] the Ontario Court of Appeal recognized a common law tort for invasion of privacy called intrusion upon seclusion. In that case, both parties were employees of the Bank of Montreal. The defendant **accessed** the plaintiff's personal banking information at least 174 times, contrary to company policy and without any legitimate reason for doing so. The plaintiff sued for invasion of privacy.  

The case was dismissed at first instance on the grounds that PIPEDA provided the appropriate remedy for invasion of privacy. Justice Sharpe, writing for a unanimous Court of Appeal, disagreed, noting the need for the common law to evolve to respond to novel threats to privacy posed by the "routine collection and aggregation of highly personal information that is readily accessible in electronic form."[^*Jones v. Tsige*, 2012 ONCA 32 at para. 68.]

The Court of Appeal canvassed the right of privacy under American jurisprudence, accepting Professor William Prosser's insight that the right to privacy embraces four separate torts, namely:

1. Intrusion upon the plaintiff's seclusion or solitude, or into his private affairs.
2. Public disclosure of embarrassing private facts about the plaintiff.
3. Publicity which places the plaintiff in a false light in the public eye.
4. Appropriation, for the defendant's advantage, of the plaintiff's name or likeness.

The Court of Appeal's decision focused narrowly on the first tort, intrusion upon seclusion, which is described in the *Restatement (Second) of Torts (2010)* as:

> One who intentionally intrudes, physically or otherwise, upon the seclusion of another or his private affairs or concerns, is subject to liability to the other for invasion of his privacy, if the invasion would be highly offensive to a reasonable person.

The Court noted that the tort includes physical intrusions into private places as well as listening or looking, with or without mechanical aids, into the plaintiff's private affairs.[^*Jones v. Tsige*, 2012 ONCA 32 at para. 20.]

In accepting and confirming the existence of a right of action for intrusion upon seclusion in Ontario, the Court held that the key elements of the cause of action in this jurisdiction are:

1. an intentional act (which includes recklessness);
2. an invasion, without lawful justification, of the plaintiff's private affairs or concerns; and
3. a reasonable person would regard the invasion as highly offensive causing distress, humiliation or anguish.[^*Jones v. Tsige*, 2012 ONCA 32 at paras. 70-71.]

The Court held that a claim for intrusion upon seclusion would only arise after "deliberate and significant" invasions of personal privacy.  Specifically, the Court held that "it is only intrusions into matters such as one's financial or health records, sexual practices and orientation, employment, diary or private correspondence that, viewed objectively on the reasonable person standard, can be described as highly offensive."[^*Jones v. Tsige*, 2012 ONCA 32 at para. 72.]

Proof of harm to a recognized economic interest is not an element of the cause of action.[^*Jones v. Tsige*, 2012 ONCA 32 at para. 71.]

The Court held that, given the intangible nature of the interest protected, damages for intrusion upon seclusion will ordinarily be measured by a modest conventional sum. However, damages should be sufficient to "mark the wrong that has been done".[^*Jones v. Tsige*, 2012 ONCA 32 at para. 87.] The Court held that the following factors will determine where in the range the case falls:

- the nature, incidence and occasion of the defendant's wrongful act;
- the effect of the wrong on the plaintiff's health, welfare, social, business or financial position;
- any relationship, whether domestic or otherwise, between the parties;
- any distress, annoyance or embarrassment suffered by the plaintiff arising from the wrong; and
- the conduct of the parties, both before and after the wrong, including any apology or offer of amends made by the defendant.[^*Jones v. Tsige*, 2012 ONCA 32 at para. 87.]

On the facts, the Court awarded damages to the plaintiff in the amount of $10,000, placing the case at the "mid-point" of damages that can be awarded for this tort. The fact that the defendant's acts were deliberate and repeated favoured a higher award.[^*Jones v. Tsige*, 2012 ONCA 32 at paras 90 and 92.]

#### The Case Law Since *Jones v. Tsige*

*Jones v. Tsige* has been cited approximately 87 times since the decision was released. Few of the cases have elaborated on the tort and many have been labour arbitration decisions. A brief summary of the most relevant cases follows below.

In *Vertolli v YouTube LLC*,[^*Vertolli v YouTube LLC*, 2012 CanLII 99832 (Ont. Small Claims).] the plaintiff police officer brought an action in respect of a video of the officer posted on YouTube arresting an individual that he wanted taken down. The plaintiff alleged, among other things, breach of privacy. The defendant, YouTube, brought a motion to dismiss the action on the grounds that it disclosed no reasonable cause of action. Specifically, the defendant argued that the only cause of action alleged in the plaintiff's claim is a breach of PIPEDA, which does not create a statutory cause of action in respect of alleged breaches of the *Act* and there is otherwise no cause of action in law for an alleged breach of PIPEDA. The Small Claims Court judge rejected the defendant's argument, affirming that PIPEDA and other similar legislation does not prevent common law claims for the tort of invasion of privacy from being brought.[^*Vertolli v YouTube LLC*, 2012 CanLII 99832 at paras. 9-17 (Ont. Small Claims).]

In *Szocik v. England and Wales (Attorney General)*,[^*Szocik v. England and Wales (Attorney General)*, 2012 BCSC 1480, aff'd 2013 BCCA 443.] the plaintiff commenced an action for, among other things, invasion of privacy under the *B.C. Privacy Act*, based on allegations that the British Secret Service had been stalking him in the United Kingdom and other countries, interfering with his brain activity and communicating with him through what he called "‘voice to skull’ mindcontrol". The defendant brought an application to dismiss the action on the basis that the court had no jurisdiction, which the Court granted. In considering the claims regarding invasion of privacy, the Court commented in *obiter*:

> The defendant contends that the conduct and communications of the SSUK agents that Mr. Szocik alleges occurred in British Columbia do not establish any violation of his privacy. In particular, the defendant contends that all of the alleged conduct occurred in a public space where a person has a low expectation of privacy. In *Wasserman v. Hall*, 2009 BCSC 1318 (CanLII) at para. 75, the Court stated that with respect to s. 1(2) of the *Privacy Act*, a person’s reasonable expectation of privacy in a public space will be substantially less than in a private place, such as his or her home.

> **The place where privacy interests are in issue does not, however, dictate whether the expectations of privacy in that place are reasonable or not.** Reasonable expectations may not exist with respect to private property and conversely, reasonable expectations may exist with respect to public places: *Heckert* at paras. 78-83. **All of the circumstances must be considered in determining whether the expectations are reasonable.**

> In this case, all of the incidents alleged by Mr. Szocik are said to have taken place in public places. Even so, he may still have had some reasonable expectations of privacy depending on the circumstances. In addition, if in fact the SSUK agents were speaking to him through the use of electronic devices, then such interference may ground a breach of his personal privacy interests in that it breached his right to seclusion and solitude: see *Young* at para. 41.[^Szocik v. England and Wales (Attorney General)*, 2012 BCSC 1480 at paras. 81-83.]

In *Lisa Ludmer v. Brian Ludmer*,[^*Lisa Ludmer v. Brian Ludmer*, 2013 ONSC 784, aff'd 2014 ONCA 827.], the respondent in a divorce proceeding claimed invasion of privacy with respect to the hacking of his email account by an individual working for the respondent's wife. The Court found no evidence that the individual read or intercepted the respondent's email and thus dismissed the claim.

In *Ari v. Insurance Corporation of British Columbia*,[^*Ari v. Insurance Corporation of British Columbia*, 2013 BCSC 1308, aff'd 2015 BCCA 468.] the plaintiff commenced a class action against the Insurance Corporation of British Columbia (ICBC) alleging that the plaintiff and at least 65 other individuals had their personal information "wilfully and without a claim of right" accessed by an employee of ICBC for an unauthorized purpose. The plaintiff's claim was based on both common law and the *B.C. Privacy Act*. The defendant brought a motion to strike. With respect to the statutory claim, the Court held that it was not plain and obvious that there was no reasonable claim in breach of privacy. While the employee was authorized to access the plaintiff’s personal information, the purpose for which the access was exercised was unauthorized.[^*Ari v. Insurance Corporation of British Columbia*, 2013 BCSC 1308 at para. 58.] The Court noted, however, that a potential weakness in the claim was the degree of privacy the plaintiff and other class members were entitled to in these circumstances, based on the nature of the information shared with ICBC, namely: names and residential addresses.[^*Ari v. Insurance Corporation of British Columbia*, 2013 BCSC 1308 at para. 59.] The Court struck the common law claim for invasion of privacy on the ground that it does not exist in B.C.[^*Ari v. Insurance Corporation of British Columbia*, 2013 BCSC 1308 at paras. 62-65.]

In *Leung v. Shanks*,[^*Leung v. Shanks*, 2013 ONSC 4943.] the plaintiff commenced an action against the defendant for, among other things, intrusion upon seclusion and breach of privacy. The plaintiff alleged that the defendant, a nurse at the fertility clinic where the plaintiff and her common law partner attended, used her personal information to invade her privacy and cause her injury. The defendant contended that the pleading was deficient  because the plaintiff voluntarily provided information to the defendant in the context of a legitimate professional situation, thus providing legal justification. Moreover, the defendant argued that the pleading contained no material facts upon which a reasonable person would find the alleged invasion "highly offensive". The Court held that the pleading was sufficient:

>  It is not plain and obvious to me that the claim would fail on the basis that Shanks, as a nurse, was entitled to access personal information.  In considering the ultimate misuse made of the information, a trier of fact could conclude that the invasion of privacy was never authorized or permitted for the purposes which it served and, therefore, was not lawfully justified.[^*Leung v. Shanks*, 2013 ONSC 4943 at para. 36.]

In *Hopkins v. Kay*,[^*Hopkins v. Kay*, 2014 ONSC 321, aff'd 2015 ONCA 112, leave to appeal refused, [2015] S.C.C.A No. 157.] the plaintiff commenced a class action alleging that approximately 280 patient records of the Peterborough Regional Health Centre were intentionally and wrongfully accessed by the Hospital, Sir Sanford Fleming College and seven employees of the Hospital without the consent of the patients. As a result of various amendments, the only claim before the court was the claim for the tort of intrusion upon seclusion or breach of privacy by virtue of the allegation that the defendants wrongfully and intentionally accessed private medical information without the consent of the patient. The hospital brought a motion to strike the claim on the basis that the *Personal Health Information Protection Act* ("**PHIPA**") occupied the field and, as such, the claims by the plaintiffs based on the common law tort of breach of privacy were precluded by PHIPA. The Court denied the motion and allowed the claim to proceed on the basis of Sharpe J.A.'s reasons in *Jones v. Tsige* relating to PIPEDA and PHIPA not precluding common law claims of breach of privacy in Ontario.[^*Hopkins v. Kay*, 2014 ONSC 321 at paras. 27-30.] The Court of Appeal upheld the judgment on the grounds that PHIPA does not create an exhaustive code.[^*Hopkins v. Kay*, 2015 ONCA 112 at para. 3.]

In *Condon v. Canada*,[^*Condon v. Canada*, 2014 FC 250, rev'd in part 2015 FCA 159. The FCA decision concerned the whether the claims of negligence and breach of confidence should have been struck. It did not deal with the invasion of privacy claim.] the plaintiffs sought certification of a class action against the Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development Canada after it lost an external hard drive on which it had stored the personal information of the plaintiffs as well as approximately 583,000 individuals. The personal information included the names, dates of birth, addresses, student loan balances, and social insurance numbers of those individuals. The plaintiffs alleged the tort of intrusion upon seclusion applied and that the defendant's conduct was reckless. The defendant argued that it was lawfully in possession of the information, the information was not sufficiently intrusive in that there is nothing deeply personal about the information that if disclosed could cause embarrassment or humiliation, and the harms of "inconvenience, frustration and anxiety," as alleged were not as dire as the "distress, humiliation or anguish" put forward by the Ontario Court of Appeal in *Jones*. The Court granted certification and accepted the pleading. It found:

- it was sufficient for the plaintiffs to plead that the information was disclosed in an unlawful way;
- the information was in fact financial information that concerned the existence and amount of a debt obligation;
- the test for a "highly offensive" intrusion does not require that the information at issue cause embarrassment or humiliation; and
- frustration and anxiety could be forms of distress.[^*Condon v. Canada*, 2014 FC 250 at paras. 58-61.]

In *Evans v. The Bank of Nova Scotia*,[^*Evans v. The Bank of Nova Scotia*, 2014 ONSC 2135.] the plaintiff sought certification of a class action against the Bank of Nova Scotia for intrusion upon seclusion and waiver of tort, based on allegations that one of the bank's employees provided private and confidential information of bank customers to his girlfriend, who then disseminated the private information to third parties for fraudulent and improper purposes. As a result of the bank employee’s conduct, a substantial number of the bank’s customers became victims of identity theft and fraud, which negatively affected their credit rating. The bank opposed certification on several grounds, including that it was not vicariously liable for the tort of intrusion upon seclusion for a deliberate breach of customers’ privacy rights by one of its employees, and there can be no waiver of tort because there is no causal connection between the allegedly wrongful conduct by the bank and the profits it generated.

With respect to the intrusion upon seclusion claim, the Court held:

> The tort of intrusion upon seclusion has only recently been recognized by the Ontario Court of Appeal and is settled in Ontario. However, until the matter is ultimately decided at the Supreme Court of Canada, I find that the law in Canada is not settled on this issue. While the Courts in British Columbia and New Brunswick have not as of yet recognized the tort of intrusion upon seclusion, I was not given caselaw to suggest that they have definitively shut the door on this cause of action. For this reason, I find that it is not plain and obvious that the plaintiffs’ claim that the Bank is vicariously liable for its employees’ tort of intrusion upon seclusion would be unsuccessful.[^*Evans v. The Bank of Nova Scotia*, 2014 ONSC 2135 at para. 26.]

The Court also permitted the claim for waiver of tort to proceed on the basis that it was possible to infer that the bank earned additional profits from its alleged wrongful conduct of failing to incur the costs necessary to ensure adequate supervision of its employees in order to protect customers’ confidential information.[^*Evans v. The Bank of Nova Scotia*, 2014 ONSC 2135 at para. 61.]

In *John Doe v. Canada*,[^*John Doe v. Canada*, 2015 FC 916, rev'd in part 2016 FCA 191.] the plaintiffs sought certification of a class action for, among other things, intrusion upon seclusion, alleging that the defendant publicly identified them as participants in the Marihuana Medical Access Program (MMAP) by sending letters in oversized envelopes through the mail system in November 2013 with the return address "Marihuana Medical Access Program". Justice Phelan granted certification, noting that the intrusion upon seclusion claim was novel and should not be struck: "The area of privacy rights, either by statute, contract or tort, is developing rapidly. It is a new area and its development or limitation should not be decided at this stage of the litigation."[^*John Doe v. Canada*, 2015 FC 916 at para. 40.] The Federal Court of Appeal reversed this aspect of the decision, however, on the basis that the respondents had not pleaded any material facts in support of the necessary elements of the claim:

> At best, the material facts pleaded support the notion that an isolated administrative error was made. This is a far cry from the situation in *Tsige*, where a bank employee accessed private financial information of the plaintiff at least 174 times over a four-year period in order to maintain surveillance over her former spouse and his new partner; moreover, Ms. Tsige was aware that her actions were wrong. Here, there are no material facts pleaded to support an allegation of bad faith or recklessness.

> Accordingly, it is plain and obvious that this cause of action could not possibly succeed. The motions judge erred in failing to dismiss this cause of action.[^*John Doe v. Canada*, 2016 FCA 191 at paras. 58-59.]

In *Chandra v CBC*,[^*Chandra v CBC*, 2015 ONSC 5303.] the plaintiff sued the defendant for defamation and breach of privacy arising from a television series that suggested the plaintiff professor had fabricated research results. The defendant argued that the common law claim for breach of privacy was precluded by operation of the PIPEDA. Alternatively, it argued that the common law tort of intrusion upon seclusion does not extend to the publication or dissemination of information by a broadcaster. Justice Mew rejected both arguments and held that because PIPEDA leaves open to a complainant the option of bringing a civil proceeding, it does not constitute a "complete code" that precludes common law causes of action for breach of privacy.[^*Chandra v CBC*, 2015 ONSC 5303 at para. 33.]

In *Doe 464533 v N.D.*,[^*Doe 464533 v N.D.*, 2016 ONSC 541.] the plaintiff sued the defendant, her ex-boyfriend, after he posted an intimate video of her on a pornography website without her knowledge or consent. The defendant did not defend the action and the plaintiff brought a motion for default judgment seeking compensatory and punitive damages for, among other things, invasion of privacy. Justice Stinson, following the holding in *Jones v. Tsige*, recognized the existence of the second privacy tort in the four-part typology identified by Sharpe J.A. in *Jones v. Tsige*, namely: public disclosure of embarrassing private facts. He held:

> I would essentially adopt as the elements of the cause of action for public disclosure of private facts the Restatement (Second) of Torts (2010) formulation, with one minor modification: One who gives publicity to a matter concerning the private life of another is subject to liability to the other for invasion of the other’s privacy, if the matter publicized *or the act of the publication* (a) would be highly offensive to a reasonable person, and (b) is not of legitimate concern to the public. [modification shown in italics]

> In the present case the defendant posted on the Internet a privately-shared and highly personal intimate video recording of the plaintiff. I find that in doing so he made public an aspect of the plaintiff’s private life. I further find that a reasonable person would find such activity, involving unauthorized public disclosure of such a video, to be highly offensive. It is readily apparent that there was no legitimate public concern in him doing so.

> I therefore conclude that this cause of action is made out.[^*Doe 464533 v N.D.*, 2016 ONSC 541 at paras. 46-48.]

The Court awarded general damages in the amount of $50,000 and punitive damages of $25,000.[^*Doe 464533 v N.D.*, 2016 ONSC 541 at paras. 58 and 63.]

In *John Stevens v Glennis Walsh*,[^*John Stevens v Glennis Walsh*, 2016 ONSC 2418.] the plaintiff sued the defendant for breach of privacy alleging that the defendant, a colleague of the plaintiff's, disclosed information from a shared calendar that is used for work purposes only, to the plaintiff's wife. The information was relevant to an ongoing divorce. The Court held that all of the elements of the tort for intrusion upon seclusion were satisfied. Specifically, Justice Harper held:

> The policy of Air Canada, that must be followed by all employees, emphasises the privacy rights of the employees. This policy specifically prohibits any employee from disseminating personal information of another employee to third parties without express permission of the other employee. The sharing of personal information between employees is clearly restricted for work related purposes only. Permission to review and obtain this information is not given unless it is for work related purposes. If the information is reviewed and used for any other purpose, this results in conduct that constitutes an intentional invasion of the private affairs or concerns. In addition, I find that a reasonable person would regard this type of invasion of privacy as highly offensive and causing distress, humiliation and anguish to the person.

> For an employee to obtain information under the guise of review for legitimate work related purposes and to then use it by sharing it with the estranged wife of a colleague against the colleague in a divorce proceeding falls within the "significant invasions of personal privacy" that is referred to in paragraph [72] of the seminal case in the Ontario Court of Appeal *Jones v. Tsige* 2012 ONCA 32 (CanLII), [2012] O.J. No. 148 (C.A.).[^*John Stevens v Glennis Walsh*, 2016 ONSC 2418 at paras. 16-17.]

In *Bennett v Lenovo*,[^*Bennett v Lenovo*, 2017 ONSC 1082.] the plaintiff lawyer commenced a proposed class action against the defendant computer manufacturer after purchasing a laptop that had been pre-loaded with an adware program that allegedly intercepted the user’s secure internet connections and scanned the user’s web traffic to inject unauthorized advertisements into the user’s web browser without the user’s knowledge or consent. The proposed class action initially advanced five causes of action: breach of contract, the implied condition of merchantability, the tort of intrusion upon seclusion, breach of provincial privacy laws and negligence. The negligence claim was withdrawn. Lenovo argued  that it was plain and obvious and beyond doubt that none of the remaining four causes of action could succeed. Justice Belobaba disagreed, allowing the claims based on merchantability, intrusion upon seclusion and breach of provincial privacy laws to continue.

Given the similarity in facts between the allegations in this case and the conduct of third party advertisers engaged in web tracking, it is worth quoting Justice Belobaba at length. On the issue of intrusion upon seclusion, Justice Belobaba held as follows:

> The plaintiff pleads that the VD program "compromises the security of sensitive personal, financial and otherwise confidential information that is commonly stored on computers and other electronic devices" by allowing hackers "to intercept a user’s internet connections … and collect their bank credentials, passwords and other highly sensitive information" including "confidential personal and financial information."

> The plaintiff further pleads that the defendants "exposed the class members to significant risks, including the risk that their personal and financial information will be stolen and sold to third parties for commercial purposes."

> Counsel for the plaintiff argues that the very act of implanting the software into the plaintiff’s laptop was an intrusion upon the plaintiff’s privacy. The software allowed private information to be sent to unknown servers without the plaintiff’s knowledge or consent. The fact that the installation created additional security vulnerabilities only increased the likelihood that further intrusions, such as third-party hackers, would occur. And further, adds counsel for the plaintiff, a reasonable person would find the secret installation of "unwanted malware" by the very entity that is selling the laptop to be highly offensive and distressful.

> In *Jones v. Tsige*, the Court of Appeal recognized a new tort called "intrusion upon seclusion". The Court identified three elements of this privacy tort: (i) the defendant’s conduct must be intentional or reckless; (ii) the defendant must have invaded, without lawful justification, the plaintiff’s private affairs or concerns; and (iii) a reasonable person would regard the invasion as highly offensive causing distress, humiliation or anguish. Proof of actual loss is not an element of this cause of action.

> The first two elements, recklessness and unlawful invasion of privacy are pleaded. The third element, distress, is not pleaded explicitly but can reasonably be inferred from the content and tone of the pleading, including the claim for punitive damages. I also note that in *Jones v Tsige*, the Court of Appeal acknowledged that the third element (distress or suffering) is "generally presumed once the first [two] elements have been established."

> The intrusion upon seclusion tort is just evolving. Its scope and content have not yet been fully determined. I am therefore not persuaded that it is plain and obvious and beyond doubt that, on the facts as pleaded, this particular privacy claim has no chance of success and is doomed to fail.[^*Bennett v Lenovo*, 2017 ONSC 1082 at paras. 17-23.]

On the issue of the provincial privacy laws, Justice Belobaba held:

> Nor am I persuaded that it is plain and obvious and beyond doubt that the claims relating to the alleged breaches of provincial privacy laws – in British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and Newfoundland and Labrador – have no chance of success and are certain to fail.

> Each of the four provincial statutes declares in essence that the unlawful violation of another’s privacy is an actionable tort, without proof of loss.

> The plaintiff pleads that VD is "one of the most malicious and invasive forms of software" that has ever been installed and distributed by a computer manufacturer or retailer. That the "malware" was designed to invade the privacy of the class members, gather information without the user’s consent and exploit that information "for unknown, illicit purposes."

> Lenovo argues that there is no pleading of any actual violation of anyone’s privacy, no allegation that any confidential information was actually hacked and appropriated, and therefore these statutory claims are certain to fail. I do not agree. This court has sensibly recognized an "increased concern in our society about the risk of unauthorized access to an individual’s personal information." The risk of unauthorized **access** to private information is itself a concern even without any **actual removal** or actual theft. For example, if a landlord installs a peephole allowing him to look into a tenant’s bathroom, the tenant would undoubtedly feel that her privacy had been invaded even if the peephole was not being used at any particular time. The same point can be made here.

> The scope and content of the provincial privacy laws in question is still evolving. In *Jones v Tsige*, the Court of Appeal noted that "no provincial legislation provides a precise definition of what constitutes an invasion of privacy." It is therefore not plain and obvious that the secret installation of a "malware" program "designed …to invade the privacy of and cause harm to the class members" is not actionable as a privacy violation under the four provincial statutes.

> I am not persuaded that that the statutory privacy claims are certain to fail.[^*Bennett v Lenovo*, 2017 ONSC 1082 at paras. 24-29.]

#### Application

##### Intentional Intrusion

Applying the elements of the cause of action to the facts of web tracking by third party advertisers, it seems likely that a court would find such conduct to constitute an intentional intrusion, thus satisfying the first element. The third party advertiser network has, for the express purpose of tracking the end user and then using that information to sell advertising opportunities, installed either a cookie or JavaScript on the end user's machine.


##### Private Affairs or Concerns

The second element of the cause of action is more problematic. The second element requires one to show that the intrusion is into a private affair or concern. Tracking one's browser history pseudonymously may or may not satisfy this criteria depending on the facts.  If one's browsing history contains innocuous material, such as one's interest in a particular soccer team, it would be difficult to say that the test has been met. The Court of Appeal's examples in *Jones v. Tsige* include information such as banking records, sexual orientation, etc. If, however, one's browsing history disclosed his or her sexual orientation, suffering of a health condition, or banking information, there is a far greater likelihood that a court would find the web tracking to be a significant intrusion into one's personal affairs.

On the facts, it could be argued that reviewing one's browsing history is very much like reviewing their journal. From such information, one can paint a very precise portrait of an individual's life. This is precisely why third party advertisers are spending so much money on technology to track this information. Further, one of the pieces of information captured by third party web trackers like those used by Krux (mentioned above) is location. Even if you have opted out of their service, they still log your IP address and your location, right down to your latitude, longitude and postal code.

The presence of IP addresses and location information in web tracking is relevant. In the U.S. case of  *Yershov v. Gannett Satellite Information Network, Inc.*,[^*Yershov v. Gannett Satellite Information Network, Inc.*, 104 F. Supp. 3d 135 (D. Mass. 2015).], the plaintiff downloaded USA Today's free application onto his smartphone. He alleged that Gannett, which publishes USA Today, shared information about videos he watched on his phone with a third party analytics company, Adobe Systems, Inc., contrary to the *Video Privacy Protection Act*. The information did not include the plaintiff's name or address, but rather his cell phone identification number and his GPS coordinates at the time he viewed a particular video. The District Court concluded that any unique identifier, including a person's smartphone ID, is personally identifiable information.[^*Yershov v. Gannett Satellite Information Network, Inc.*, 104 F. Supp. 3d 135 (D. Mass. 2015) at 145-146.] The Court found that the Act applied to the disclosure of static identifiers that could *theoretically* permit a company like Adobe Systems to identify an individual video watcher. The First Circuit recently affirmed that conclusion.[^*Yershov v. Gannett Satellite Info. Network, Inc.*, 820 F.3d 482 at 482-483 (1st Cir. 2016). A similar argument concerning information about a device's unique profile constituting personal information was also raised in *In re: Nickelodeon Consumer Privacy Litigation*,[^*In re: Nickelodeon Consumer Privacy Litigation*, 827 F.3d 262], discussed in more detail below.] While not authority in Canada, such cases may be persuasive in establishing that the type of information collected by third party advertising web trackers is more personally identifiable than one would generally believe.

Further, the OPC has held in its Guidance and Policy Position that such information is likely personal information because of the serious possibility that it can be used to identify an individual. Moreover, Justice Belobaba's statements in *Bennett v Lenovo* regarding the concern for **access** to information are persuasive and in accordance with the OPC's findings in the Bell RAP case. Taken together, these cases suggest that it should not matter whether the third party advertiser collected innocuous or seriously personal information to satisfy this branch of the test. If the intrusion is unauthorized, simple access to personal information, sensitive or otherwise, may be enough to establish an intrusion into a private affair or concern.

While *Charter* cases are of limited application in civil cases regarding intrusion upon seclusion, it is also helpful to note in this regard that the Supreme Court of Canada has recognized 'anonymity' as a core principle of privacy for the purposes of s. 8 *Charter* rights.[^*R. v. Spencer*, 2014 SCC 43.]  In *R. v. Spencer*,[^*R. v. Spencer*, 2014 SCC 43.] the police identified the IP address of a computer that someone had been using to access child pornography. Without prior judicial authorization, the police obtained from the ISP the subscriber information associated with the IP address. At issue was whether the police conducted an unlawful 'search' under s. 8 of the *Charter* by obtaining the subscriber information. Justice Cromwell, writing for a unanimous Court, held that they had, acknowledging that "privacy in relation to information includes at least three conceptually distinct although overlapping understandings of what privacy is. These are privacy as secrecy, privacy as control and privacy as anonymity." On the issue of anonymity, he held:

> [T]he Internet has exponentially increased both the quality and quantity of information that is stored about Internet users. Browsing logs, for example, may provide detailed information about users’ interests. Search engines may gather records of users’ search terms. Advertisers may track their users across networks of websites, gathering an overview of their interests and concerns. “Cookies” may be used to track consumer habits and may provide information about the options selected within a website, which web pages were visited before and after the visit to the host website and any other personal information provided: see N. Gleicher, “Neither a Customer Nor a Subscriber Be: Regulating the Release of User Information on the World Wide Web” (2009), 118 Yale L.J. 1945, at pp. 1948-49; R. W. Hubbard, P. DeFreitas and S. Magotiaux, “The Internet — Expectations of Privacy in a New Context” (2002), 45 Crim. L.Q. 170, at pp. 189-91. The user cannot fully control or even necessarily be aware of who may observe a pattern of online activity, but by remaining anonymous — by guarding the link between the information and the identity of the person to whom it relates — the user can in large measure be assured that the activity remains private: see Slane and Austin, at pp. 500-3.

> Doherty J.A. made this point with his usual insight and clarity in Ward. “Personal privacy” he wrote “protects an individual’s ability to function on a day-to-day basis within society while enjoying a degree of anonymity that is essential to the individual’s personal growth and the flourishing of an open and democratic society”: para. 71. He concluded that some degree of anonymity is a feature of much Internet activity and that, “[d]epending on the totality of the circumstances, . . . anonymity may enjoy constitutional protection under s. 8”: para. 75. I agree. Thus, anonymity may, depending on the totality of the circumstances, be the foundation of a privacy interest that engages constitutional protection against unreasonable search and seizure.[^*R. v. Spencer*, 2014 SCC 43 at paras. 46-48.]

Where web tracking by third party advertisers creates persistent UIDs or device IDs that follow a user from site to site, the argument that IP addresses and other information about the device provides only "passive", "anonymous" or "pseudonymous" data begins to lose force, as such conduct engages an interest in anonymity recognized by Canada's highest court as worthy of constitutional protection.

Ultimately, the question of whether third party tracking is an intrusion into one's private affairs or concerns will turn on the facts and the degree to which one can demonstrate that the information collected by a third party advertiser was in some way private or personal information and was accessed without authorization.

##### Without Lawful Justification / Consent

The second element of the test also requires that the defendant's conduct be without lawful justification. On this branch, the issue appears on the facts of this case to be one of consent. A third party advertiser will likely argue that an end-user has consented to web tracking by virtue of their acceptance of their own, or the first party's, privacy policy.

There are two issues at stake in any consent debate. The first issue concerns one's implicit acceptance of terms of use and privacy policies through the so-called doctrine of "browsewrap" agreements. A browsewrap agreement is an online agreement that is sometimes used by website operators to obtain agreement to the use of a website and its contents. Unlike a "clickwrap" agreement, the terms are not expressly agreed to by clicking on an "agree" icon. Rather, agreement is manifested by use of the site, services or content with sufficient notice of the terms and knowledge that the use constitutes acceptance of the terms.

The law regarding the enforcement of browsewrap agreements is murky at best. There is a line of cases at common law that suggests that the terms of such an agreement are binding if the website operator has taken steps that are reasonably sufficient to give subscribers notice of its terms. It does not have to ensure that subscribers are aware of the terms. Nor is it required to obtain any acknowledgement that the terms in question were read and accepted.[^See *Century 21 Canada Limited Partnership v. Rogers Communications Inc.*, 2011 BCSC 1196.] In *Century 21 Canada Limited Partnership v. Rogers Communications Inc.*,[^*Century 21 Canada Limited Partnership v. Rogers Communications Inc.*, 2011 BCSC 1196.] a case involving two commercial parties wherein one was screen scraping information from another, contrary to their terms of use, the Court accepted that the general principles in the common law ticket cases applied to determine if terms on websites are enforceable against website users. The Court stated:

> The final form of agreement referred to is a "browse wrap" agreement. A browse wrap agreement does not require that the purchaser indicate their agreement by clicking on an "I Agree" button. All that is required is that they use the product after being made aware of the product’s Terms of Use….

> As noted in the authorities referred to above, the law of contract requires that the offer and its terms be brought to the attention of the user, be available for review and be in some manner accepted by the user. Such an analysis turns on the prominence the site gives to the proposed Terms of Use and the notice that the user has respecting what they are agreeing to once they have accepted the offer. To establish a binding contract consideration will also be given to whether the user is an individual consumer or a commercial entity and in addition a one-time user or a frequent user of the site.

> Browse wrap agreements have the advantage of being readily available for perusal by the user. Their enforcement requires a clear opportunity for the user to read them which, given the nature of computer and the Internet, is likely to be a better opportunity than that available to the user of a product with a standard form contract presented at the time of purchase. **A properly enforceable browse wrap agreement will give the user the opportunity to read it before deeming the consumer’s use of the website as acceptance of the Terms of Use**.

> Taking the service with sufficient notice of the Terms of Use and knowledge that the taking of the service is deemed agreement constitutes acceptance sufficient to form a contract. The act of browsing past the initial page of the website or searching the site is conduct indicating agreement with the Terms of Use if those terms are provided with sufficient notice, are available for review prior to acceptance, and clearly state that proceeding further is acceptance of the terms.

It is important to note that, even in this case involving two commercial parties, the Court has emphasized the importance that the user have the opportunity to read a browsewrap agreement before deeming use of a website as consent to its terms. In the case of web tracking, the third party's terms are often not present on, or even linked from, the first party site. Further, and in any event, unlike social network services like Facebook and Google where users must more explicitly sign up and assent to terms of use, first party sites such as theglobeandmail.com or vice.com have no such requirement. The third party tracking occurs instantly when the page loads, prior to even your ability to read the first party's terms of service or privacy policy.

In *Douez v. Facebook Inc.*[^*Douez v. Facebook Inc.*, 2014 BCSC 953, rev'd 2015 BCCA 279, leave to appeal granted, [2015] S.C.C.A. No. 367.] Justice Griffin called attention to the fact that *Century 21* was an agreement between sophisticated commercial parties who employ similar terms and who had conceded the reasonableness of the terms of use at issue. The Court noted that the reasonableness of the terms and the sufficiency of the notice were not at issue in *Century 21* and allowed the certification. While Griffin J. was ultimately overturned by the B.C. Court of Appeal, no mention was made of the *Century 21* analysis and the decision was overturned for reasons of jurisdiction and comity.

Further, the Federal Court has more recently held that a browsewrap agreement for a small Canadian online news agency was not enforceable or binding on a user who shared and distributed copies of an article published on the agency's website.[^See in *1395804 Ontario Ltd. (Blacklock’s Reporter) v. Canada (Attorney General)*, 2016 FC 1255; see also Barry Sookman's analysis at [http://www.barrysookman.com/2017/02/01/pipedas-global-extra-territorial-jurisdiction-a-t-v-globe24h-com/](http://www.barrysookman.com/2017/02/01/pipedas-global-extra-territorial-jurisdiction-a-t-v-globe24h-com/).] On this issue, Justice Barnes stated:

> I agree with Mr. Hameed that the deliberate breach of the accepted terms of access to and use of copyrighted material, whether protected by a paywall or not, is a relevant consideration in applying the fair dealing provisions of the Act. However, the owner of copyright must establish that the terms of use actually prohibit the access or distribution in question and that the person involved was aware of the limitations…

> It is a simple exercise to bring the stipulated terms of use to the attention of a subscriber to a paywall-protected news service. All that is required is an acknowledgement at the time of acquiring access that the terms in question were read and accepted.

> In this case Blacklock’s failed to ensure that its subscribers were aware of the Terms and Conditions it sought to impose. According to Mr. Korski and Ms. Doan, an astute or sophisticated subscriber to Blacklock’s would be aware of its limitations on use by the reference on the application form to bulk user access and by the generic reference to "Terms and Conditions" at the foot of every website page.

> In my view Blacklock’s approach is deficient and potentially misleading to subscribers like Ms. Marsden. Because the Terms and Conditions of use were not clearly brought to Ms. Marsden’s attention for acceptance, she had no reason to think that by sharing the two Blacklock’s articles she was breaching Blacklock’s copyright or facilitating a breach by others.

> **The requirement for bringing contractual conditions to the attention of a subscriber at the time of purchase is well-known in the law. It is not something that is imposed by bare inference or by falling back on the supposed sophistication of users. At a minimum the party to be bound must be shown to have been aware of the Terms and Conditions at the time of purchase:** see *Kobelt Manufacturing Co v Pacific Rim Engineered Products* (1987) Ltd, 2011 BCSC 224 at para 124, 84 BLR (4th) 189.

At least one technology lawyer has suggested that the Federal Court's ruling in *Blacklock's Reporter* is wrong;[^Barry Sookman, "Browsewraps, fair dealing and Blacklock’s Reporter v Canada: a critical commentary", [http://www.barrysookman.com/2017/01/02/browsewraps-fair-dealing-and-blacklocks-reporter-v-canada-a-critical-commentary/](http://www.barrysookman.com/2017/01/02/browsewraps-fair-dealing-and-blacklocks-reporter-v-canada-a-critical-commentary/).] however, this analysis overstates the significance of *Century 21*'s application to cases involving unsophisticated end users.

Moreover, the ambiguity in Canadian case law is equally well reflected in U.S. jurisprudence.[^Venkat Balasubramani and Eric Goldman, "Anarchy Has Ensued In Courts’ Handling of Online Contract Formation (Round Up Post)", [http://blog.ericgoldman.org/archives/2016/08/anarchy-has-ensued-in-courts-handling-of-online-contract-formation-round-up-post.htm](http://blog.ericgoldman.org/archives/2016/08/anarchy-has-ensued-in-courts-handling-of-online-contract-formation-round-up-post.htm); Venkat Balasubramani and Eric Goldman, "Judge Declines to Enforce Uber’s Terms of Service–Meyer v. Kalanick", [http://blog.ericgoldman.org/archives/2016/08/judge-declines-to-enforce-ubers-terms-of-service-meyer-v-kalanick.htm](http://blog.ericgoldman.org/archives/2016/08/judge-declines-to-enforce-ubers-terms-of-service-meyer-v-kalanick.htm).] In *Meyer v. Kalanick*,[^Meyer v. Kalanick*, 2016 WL 4073012 (S.D.N.Y. July 29, 2016).] for example, the plaintiff commenced an antitrust suit against Travis Kalanick, the founder of Uber, alleging that Mr. Kalanick “orchestrated and participated in an antitrust conspiracy.” Uber moved successfully to intervene, and then moved to force arbitration. The court denies the motion to compel arbitration, finding fault with Uber’s contract formation process. Uber’s contracting process at the time required someone to input their payment details, and then “register” to form an account. The text under the “register” button said:

> By creating an Uber account, you agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.

The terms of service and privacy policy were links, and if a user clicked on the links, he or she was taken to a screen where they had to press another button to access the terms. The plaintiff said he did not recall the hyperlink or clicking it, and Uber did not contest this. The Court noted the distinction between clickwrap and browsewrap agreements and held that clickwrap agreements "are more readily enforceable" because the user is on inquiry notice of the agreement. Ultimately the court held that labels don’t help with what is a fact-specific inquiry, and the key question is the conspicuousness of the terms. Uber’s account creation process did not score well from this perspective: given the screen size, the Court found that the text was small and the font did not call attention to the terms. Even the wording of the hyperlink was not designed to bring the terms to an average consumer’s attention:

> Further still, the wording of Uber’s hyperlink adds to the relative obscurity of Uber’s User Agreement. The Court cannot simply assume that the reasonable (non-lawyer) smartphone user is aware of the likely contents of "Terms of Service," especially when that phrase is placed directly alongside "Privacy Policy." There is, after all, a “breadth of the range of technological savvy of online purchasers” (and smartphone users).

In the end, the court says that if Uber wanted a consumer to waive core legal rights such as the right to a jury trial, it should have made the sign-up process harder:

> There is a real risk here that Uber’s registration screen "made joining [Uber] fast and simple and made it appear – falsely – that being a [user] imposed virtually no burdens on the consumer besides payment."

The primary conclusion to be drawn from this case and others like it in the United States[^See Venkat Balasubramani and Eric Goldman, "Anarchy Has Ensued In Courts’ Handling of Online Contract Formation (Round Up Post)", [http://blog.ericgoldman.org/archives/2016/08/anarchy-has-ensued-in-courts-handling-of-online-contract-formation-round-up-post.htm](http://blog.ericgoldman.org/archives/2016/08/anarchy-has-ensued-in-courts-handling-of-online-contract-formation-round-up-post.htm) for an excellent summary.] is that courts are generally reluctant to give effect to terms that are not conspicuous and serve to limit the rights of unsophisticated plaintiffs.[^See also *Seidel v. TELUS Communications Inc.*, 2011 SCC 15, where the Supreme Court of Canada refused to enforce an arbitration clause in a contract of adhesion on the basis that the B.C. Business Practices and Consumer Protection Act made void any agreement that would waive or release "rights, benefits or protections" conferred by the statute. Although a very different case, it reflects a general unwillingness on the part of the judiciary to enforce standard form contracts that deny plaintiffs their rights.]

Moreover, it is not likely that the issue of consent to terms and policies of a third party advertiser from a first party website is in any way a barrier to certification. In the B.C. case of *Douez v. Facebook Inc.*, which involved issues of consent with respect to a first party, the B.C. Supreme Court would have granted certification notwithstanding Facebook's argument that the plaintiff consented to the use of her likeness in Facebook's terms of use. On this issue, the Court held:

> I agree with the plaintiff that to the extent a user's consent to be featured in a Sponsored Story could be obtained by Facebook based on a user accepting its standard form Terms of Use, alone or in combination with that user's setting of privacy settings and taking of "like" actions, is a common issue for the class.

> [...]

> I agree with the plaintiff. There are a limited number of online actions that could be taken by a Facebook user to support Facebook's argument that the user implicitly consented to the use of his or her name or portrait in a Sponsored Story. The question of whether or not these online actions can constitute implied consent will be the same for each Facebook user who took the same online actions. It is not necessary that each class member be identically situated.

To be sure, this decision was overturned on jurisdictional grounds and the final result in this case awaits the Supreme Court of Canada's comment. But the fact remains that in a case where a user is exposed to web tracking by a third party advertiser on a first party website, the issue of whether the third party had lawful justification is likely to be a common issue, given the standardization of terms and policies in play.

In general, there is ground to be cautiously optimistic that this element of the intrusion upon seclusion test can be made out against a third party advertiser engaged in web tracking. Many first party privacy policies do not disclose who the third party advertising networks are, what secondary uses they may make of the information collected, or what the consequences of failing to opt-out of their web tracking will be. For example, to find out which third parties are tracking you on theglobeandmail.com, and what the policies of those third parties are, one has to open up their web inspector and monitor the network traffic or use a browser extension like Ghostery. Then, once one discerns the companies involved in the advertising, the user has to go to the third party website to review that advertiser's privacy policy. Accordingly, even if one concedes that they have consented to the first party's terms of use and privacy policy, the total dearth of information concerning the third parties makes informed, meaningful consent impossible. Without informed notice, there can be no consent.

In summary, in a case commenced against a third party advertiser that is not also a first party service provider (*e.g.* Google or Facebook are both first parties and third parties, which puts them in a different position), there is a much stronger argument that the third party's terms or privacy policy, which are not visible or directly linked from the first party website, are not consented to and provide no lawful justification for the surveillance and snooping of the third party advertiser. Where the defendant is also a first party, it is more difficult to argue a lack of consent because the user must typically assent to the terms and privacy policy as a condition of signing up for an account. In that case, the case law regarding browsewrap agreements and whether the defendant provided the plaintiff with adequate notice of the terms will be relevant. Under that body of law, the reasonableness of the terms will likely dictate a court's willingness to find a binding enforceable agreement or not.

##### A reasonable person would regard the invasion as highly offensive causing distress, humiliation or anguish

There is a dearth of similar case law to help determine whether the third element of the cause of action could be met in cases where a third party advertiser engages in web tracking. However, Justice Belobaba's decision in *Bennett v Lenovo* suggests that a Court would not find a claim against a third party advertiser to be doomed to fail on this aspect of the test.

Further, while evidence of collection of sensitive personal information such as financial records or documents that reveal health or medical issues would aid in any case commenced by a representative plaintiff, the Federal Court's statement in *Condon v. Canada* that the information itself need not cause humiliation is important. So long as the collection can be shown to cause one frustration and anxiety, it could be argued that is enough to satisfy the third branch of the test.

The meaning of this branch of the test was given some elaboration in U.S. jurisprudence. Specifically, two notable class actions related to web tracking were granted standing  on the basis of common law claims for intrusion upon seclusion, after all federal statutory claims were dismissed. The primary fact in both cases, however, was that the defendant had made public statements that were contrary to its actual web tracking practices. In both cases, the Third Circuit held that a finder of fact could find such conduct to be "highly offensive".

In *In re: Google Inc. Cookie Placement Consumer Privacy Litigation*,[^*In re: Google Inc. Cookie Placement Consumer Privacy Litigation*, 806 F.3d 125. The case was ultimately settled for $5.5 million to be used for *cy pres* contributions. See 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14646.] the plaintiffs sued Google for placing tracking cookies on the plaintiffs' web browsers in contravention of their browsers' cookie blockers and Google's own public statements. This litigation arose from the Jonathan Mayer's research on Google's circumvention of Apple's Safari browser cookie blocking feature.[^See Jonathan Mayer, "Safari Trackers", Web Policy, [http://webpolicy.org/2012/02/17/safari-trackers/](http://webpolicy.org/2012/02/17/safari-trackers/); Jonathan Mayer, "Setting the Record Straight on Google’s Safari Tracking", Web Policy, [http://webpolicy.org/2012/02/20/setting-the-record-straight-on-googles-safari-tracking/](http://webpolicy.org/2012/02/20/setting-the-record-straight-on-googles-safari-tracking/).] According to Mayer's research, Google used code to command users' web browsers to automatically submit a hidden form to Google when users visited websites embedded with Google advertisements. This covert form triggered the exception to the cookie blocker, and, used widely, enabled the broad placement of cookies on Safari browsers notwithstanding that the blocker -- as Google publicly acknowledged -- was designed to prevent just that. The question of standing turned on whether the plaintiffs were able to show "injury in fact". The trial court dismissed all claims. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit dismissed claims against Google under the *Federal Wiretap Act*, *Stored Communications Act* and *Computer Fraud and Abuse Act* but left the claim for the tort of intrusion upon seclusion standing, holding that the plaintiffs had demonstrated injury in fact. Specifically, the Court held:

> In dismissing the freestanding privacy claims, the District Court concluded that Google's alleged practices "did not rise to the level of a serious invasion of privacy or an egregious breach of social norms." Contending the District Court got it right, Google says the plaintiffs voluntarily sent Google all the internet usage information at issue. Moreover, Google argues, tracking cookies are routine. Pointing to cases describing cookies as, more or less, innocuous, Google offers that courts "routinely" find no actionable privacy invasion in cases involving tracking, collation, and disclosure of internet usage information. Google gives particular attention to *Low v. LinkedIn*, where the Northern District of California explained that "[e]ven disclosure of personal information, including social security numbers, does not constitute an 'egregious breach of the social norms' to establish an invasion of privacy claim."

> For purposes of California privacy law, Google's emphasis on tracking and disclosure amounts to a smokescreen. What is notable about this case is *how* Google accomplished its tracking. Allegedly, this was by overriding the plaintiffs' cookie blockers, while concurrently announcing in its Privacy Policy that internet users could "reset your browser to refuse all cookies." Google further assured Safari users specifically that their cookie blockers meant that using Google's in-house prophylactic would be extraneous. Characterized by deceit and disregard, the alleged conduct raises different issues than tracking or disclosure alone.

> Directly pertinent to whether Google's alleged practices implicated a protected privacy interest, California tort law treats as actionable an "unwanted access to data by electronic or other covert means, in violation of the law or social norms." Moreover, the California Constitution protects an interest in "conducting personal activities without observation," with the reasonableness of any given expectation "rest[ing] on an examination of customs . . . as well as the opportunity to be notified in advance and consent to the intrusion." To Google's point, a sophisticated internet user may well have known that, in browsing the internet, her URL information was sent to Google. But such a user would also reasonably expect that her activated cookie blocker meant her URL queries would not be associated with each other due to cookies. As the activated cookie blocker equates, in our view, to an express, clearly communicated denial of consent for installation of cookies, we find Google "intru[ded] upon reasonable expectations of privacy."

> **As for whether the alleged conduct is "so serious in nature[] [and] scope . . . as to constitute an egregious breach of the social norms," Google not only contravened the cookie blockers--it held itself out as respecting the cookie blockers. Whether or not data-based targeting is the internet's pole star, users are entitled to deny consent, and they are entitled to rely on the public promises of the companies they deal with.** Furthermore, Google's alleged conduct was broad, touching untold millions of internet users; it was surreptitious, surfacing only because of the independent research of Mayer and the Wall Street Journal; and it was of indefinite duration, with Google's counsel conceding at argument that their tracking cookies have no natural lifespan. Particularly as concerns Google's public statements regarding the Safari cookie blocker, we see no justification. Neither, apparently, do the elected branches, as California and federal executive agencies have themselves sought to penalize Google for the events alleged in the complaint. **Based on the pled facts, a reasonable factfinder could indeed deem Google's conduct "highly offensive" or "an egregious breach of social norms."**

> A reasonable jury could conclude that Google's alleged practices constitute the serious invasion of privacy contemplated by California law. We will vacate the dismissal of the plaintiffs' claims under the California Constitution and California tort law.[^*In re: Google Inc. Cookie Placement Consumer Privacy Litigation*, 806 F.3d 125 at 150-152.]

Similarly, in *In re: Nickelodeon Consumer Privacy Litigation*,[^*In re: Nickelodeon Consumer Privacy Litigation*, 827 F.3d 262.] the plaintiffs alleged that Viacom (the owner of the Nickelodeon website, Nick.com) and Google unlawfully used Internet cookies to track children’s web browsing and video-watching habits on Viacom’s websites. The plaintiffs alleged that Viacom collected and disclosed to Google, and that Google collected and tracked, children’s user name/alias, gender, birthdate, IP addresses, browser settings, unique device identifier, operating system, screen resolution, browser version, web communications and persistent cookie identifiers. The nick.com website contained the following message:

> HEY GROWN-UPS: We don’t collect ANY personal information about your kids. Which means we couldn’t share it even if we wanted to! [^*In re: Nickelodeon Consumer Privacy Litigation*, 827 F.3d 262 at 269.]

The plaintiffs argued that the above message, coupled with Viacom’s collection, and sharing with Google, of personal information about children, invaded the children’s privacy by encroaching on their reasonable expectations of solitude. The district court dismissed plaintiffs’ New Jersey state common law intrusion upon seclusion claim. The Third Circuit vacated and remanded. In doing so, it held:

> **In our view, the wrong at the heart of the plaintiffs’ intrusion claim is not that Viacom and Google collected children’s personal information, or even that they disclosed it. Rather, it is that Viacom created an expectation of privacy on its websites and then obtained the plaintiffs’ personal information under false pretenses.**

> [...]

> Indeed, we confronted a similar allegation last year in Google. The plaintiffs there alleged that Google had evaded browser-based cookie blockers even as it held itself out as respecting them. We concluded that the alleged gap between Google’s public-facing comments and its actual behavior was problematic enough for a jury to conclude that Google committed ‘an egregious breach of social norms.’ In our view, the problem was not disclosure per se. Rather, what was notable was how Google accomplished its tracking—i.e., through deceit and disregard that raised different issues than tracking or disclosure alone. In those circumstances, a reasonable factfinder could indeed deem Google’s conduct highly offensive or an egregious breach of social norms. We think the same is true here.

The results in *Google* and *Nickelodeon* seems to be driven by the fact that the defendants' tracking was contrary to their previous public statements. Other cases, in which such facts were not present, have not been granted standing to continue to trial on the basis that the plaintiffs were unable to show "injury in fact", as required under Article III of the Constitution.

- In *In Re Facebook Internet Tracking Litigation*,[^*In Re Facebook Internet Tracking Litigation*, 140 F. Supp. 3d 922.] the plaintiffs commenced a $15 billion class action against Facebook for breaches of a number of statutes as well as invasion of privacy and intrusion upon seclusion, alleging that Facebook tracked and stored their post-logout internet usage using cookies embedded in their computers' browsers. The Court held that the plaintiffs had failed to demonstrate "injury in fact" to secure standing because they failed to show that they personally lost the opportunity to sell their information or that the value of their information was somehow diminished after it was collected by Facebook.[^*In Re Facebook Internet Tracking Litigation*, 140 F. Supp. 3d 922 at 930-932.]
- Similarly, in *Low v. LinkedIn Corporation*,[^*Low v. LinkedIn Corporation*, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 130840 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 11, 2011).] the plaintiff alleged economic loss from LinkedIn's practice of transmitting users' personal information, such as the name of each user and his or her profile viewing history, to third party tracking cookies which allowed the recipients to aggregate the data. The the court found the plaintiff's allegations "too abstract and hypothetical to support Article III" standing.[^*Low v. LinkedIn Corporation*, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 130840 at *10 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 11, 2011).] The court reasoned that the plaintiff failed to demonstrate that he personally suffered some type of real economic harm due to the transmission of his personal information.[^*Low v. LinkedIn Corporation*, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 130840 at *12-15 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 11, 2011).]
- In *In re Google Inc. Cookie Placement Consumer Privacy Litigation ("Google Cookie Placement")*,[^*In re Google Inc. Cookie Placement Consumer Privacy Litigation ("Google Cookie Placement")*, 988 F. Supp. 2d 434 (D. Del. Oct. 9, 2013).] the plaintiffs alleged that Google had employed third-party cookies to track consumer internet browsing for use in targeted advertising without first obtaining consent to do so. The Delaware district court accepted the plaintiffs' contention that their personally identifiable information had "some modicum of identifiable value to an individual plaintiff."[^*In re Google Inc. Cookie Placement Consumer Privacy Litigation ("Google Cookie Placement")*, 988 F. Supp. 2d 434 at 442 (D. Del. Oct. 9, 2013).] But the court found that value alone was insufficient to establish Article III standing, explaining that the plaintiffs had not "sufficiently alleged that the ability to monetize their [personally identifiable information had] been diminished or lost by virtue of Google's collection of it."[^*In re Google Inc. Cookie Placement Consumer Privacy Litigation ("Google Cookie Placement")*, 988 F. Supp. 2d 434 at 442 (D. Del. Oct. 9, 2013).]

The law of standing in the U.S. is not the law in Canada and Justice Sharpe was clear in *Jones v. Tsige* that proof of harm to a recognized economic interest is not an element of the cause of action. As a result, these decisions, even if binding on a Canadian court, would not appear to foreclose an action in Ontario for intrusion upon seclusion based on similar factual allegations. The *Google* and *Nickelodeon* cases nonetheless suggest that a case wherein a defendant is conducting web tracking contrary to its privacy policy or terms of use, or other previous public statement, would be more likely to succeed in elevating the conduct at issue to a "highly offensive" nature. For example, where a third party provides an opt-out mechanism, but then continues to track the end user, one could likely argue successfully that such deceitful conduct is highly offensive and also voids consent.

In the absence of such deceitful conduct, it remains unclear how a court would view collection of personal information via web trackers. Assuming it can be shown that the information collected was of a personal nature and was not authorized by the user because there was no meaningful consent, it seems unlikely that a Court could then find that the intrusion is not "highly offensive". The previous two elements combined suggest a result wherein the reasonable person would feel some distress.[^This is in part informed by Justice Sharpe's observation of this branch of the test under U.S. jurisprudence in *Jones v. Tsige*, where he stated that this element of the test "has received considerably less attention as anguish and suffering are generally presumed once the first elements have been established." See *Jones v. Tsige*, 2012 ONCA 32 at para. 60.]

### Waiver of Tort

#### General Principles

Waiver of tort is a doctrine whereby the plaintiff gives up the right to sue in tort and instead elects to base the claim in restitution, thereby seeking to recoup the benefits that the defendant has derived from the tortious conduct.[^Maddaugh and McCamus, "The Law of Restitution", [loose-leaf] at 24-1.] Accordingly, in certain situations where a tort has been committed, it may be to the plaintiff's advantage to seek recovery of an unjust enrichment accruing to the defendant rather than normal tort damages. Maddaugh and McCamus suggest that breach of privacy cases are particularly well suited for this kind of claim since there is often no damages to award.

In the case of common claims of intrusion upon seclusion, it is clear on the basis of Justice Sharpe's opinion in *Jones v. Tsige* that nominal damages can in fact be awarded where the conduct at issue simply concerned "access" to an individual's private information and did not result in any other damages. There is no case law in Canada yet that would help understand how this would be applied in a class action context; however, if nominal damages were applied among several class members, the damages could in the aggregate be substantial.

Alternatively, if waiver of tort is argued, the class could seek to recoup what the third party advertiser has made through its tortious conduct.

The leading case in Canada on waiver of tort in the context of class action certifications is the Supreme Court of Canada's decision in *Pro-Sys Consultants Ltd. v. Microsoft Corp.*[^*Pro-Sys Consultants Ltd. v. Microsoft Corp.*, 2013 SCC 57.] In that case, a class action was commenced against the defendant Microsoft on behalf of the ultimate consumers of computers containing components initially supplied to the manufacturers thereof by Microsoft. It was alleged that the prices of those components were inflated as a result of anti-competitive activity on the part of Microsoft that contravened the provisions of the *Competition Act*. The theory of the claim was that the improperly obtained overcharges paid by the manufacturers (the direct purchasers) were passed on through the distribution chain ultimately to the consumers or retail purchasers (the indirect purchasers) of the computers. The plaintiff class asserted several causes of action, including:

- compensation under the civil damages remedy under s. 36 of the *Competition Act*;
- conspiracy;
- intentional infliction of economic loss; and
- unjust enrichment, framed alternatively as either a claim in waiver of tort or on the basis of the tripartite unjust enrichment analysis set out in *Garland v. Consumers' Gas Co.*[^*Garland v. Consumers' Gas Co.*, [2004] 1 S.C.R. 629.]

The Supreme Court rejected Microsoft's argument that indirect purchasers who have borne the burden of overcharges extracted at the top of the distribution claim have no claim against the initial recipient of the overcharges simply because they have had no direct dealings with that party. The claim for waiver of tort was thus permitted to proceed.

The Supreme Court allowed the claim for waiver of tort to proceed on the basis that the doctrine was uncertain, its legal basis unsettled, and so it was not plain and obvious that the claims should fail.

The uncertainty in the courts surrounding the doctrine of waiver of tort is whether this doctrine is an independent cause of action, or is merely parasitic, in that it provides an alternate remedy for a tortious wrongdoing already proven.  

The concept of waiver of tort as an independent cause of action gained impetus in Canada from two judgments in *Serhan Estate v. Johnson & Johnson*.[^*Serhan Estate v. Johnson & Johnson*, 85 OR (3d) 665 (Div.Ct.).] The case involved an application by users of a defective blood glucose monitoring device for certification of a class action against the manufacturers and distributors. Since the plaintiffs had not purchased the monitors, nor suffered harm, their potential causes of action were limited. Cullity J. nevertheless found the claim alleged material facts that, if proven, could entitle the class to a restitutionary remedy based on waiver of tort as an independent cause of action. Although the judgment is somewhat unclear as to the underlying wrongful conduct that provided a basis for certification, on appeal Justice Epstein accepted the waiver of tort claim was grounded in conspiracy. She summarized the impact of this at para. 49 of her judgment:

> The importance of the issue of whether or not waiver of tort is an independent cause of action is that the court below concluded that this action may be grounded in the wrongful conduct of the defendants in the form of conspiracy, without any need to make out all the elements of a conspiracy, most notably proof of loss. It is only the tortious conduct, that is, the act of conspiring, that need be shown to entitle the plaintiffs to a remedy. This remedy could take the form of either the proprietary remedy of a constructive trust, or a personal remedy for an accounting and disgorgement.

Epstein J. reviewed the academic and jurisprudential debate surrounding waiver of tort and concluded since the law as to its precise status was unsettled the plaintiff's claim was not certain to fail. She accepted the doctrine raised difficult issues and important policy concerns that were best resolved with the benefit of a full factual record, and accordingly dismissed the appeal.

The decision in *Serhan* has had significant precedential force. In Ontario, waiver of tort has since been certified as a potential cause of action in many class proceedings, but often without much analysis, on the basis the uncertainty surrounding the doctrine precludes a finding it is plain and obvious that it is not an independent cause of action.[^See the cases referenced in *Koubi v. Mazda Canada Inc.*, 2012 BCCA 310 at para. 30.]

Justice Lax, in the case of *Anderson v. St. Jude Medical Inc.*,[^*Anderson v. St. Jude Medical Inc.*, 2012 ONSC 3660.] wrote a decision in the only waiver of tort case to actually go to trial. She ruled against the plaintiff on the basis that no wrongdoing had been demonstrated, however, and so refrained from any deep analysis on the grounds that it would be "academic".

#### Statutory Breaches and the Case Law Since Pro-Sys

The predicate wrongful conduct for the waiver of tort claim in *Pro-Sys* included both common law torts and statutory breaches. The case law since *Pro-Sys* suggests that a claim alleging solely a breach of a statutory obligation as the predicate wrongdoing for waiver of tort is unlikely to succeed past certification, but a claim of waiver of tort in a case that alleges both breaches of PIPEDA and the tort of intrusion of seclusion as the wrongful actions grounding the waiver of tort could in fact succeed.

In *Koubi v. Mazda Canada Inc.*,[^*Koubi v. Mazda Canada Inc.*, 2012 BCCA 310, leave to appeal refused, [2012] S.C.C.A. No. 398.] for example, the representative plaintiff in a proposed class action sued Mazda Canada for defective door locks installed in Mazda3 vehicles for, among other things, statutory breaches of the *Business Practices and Consumer Protection Act* and the *Sale of Goods Act*, and waiver of tort. The Supreme Court judge certified the class proceeding and Mazda appealed. The issue before the B.C. Court of Appeal was whether the statutory breaches may provide a foundation for a claim in waiver of tort, resulting in an award of restitutionary damages and disgorgement of Mazda's profits. The Court held that they do not and thus allowed the appeal. In coming to this conclusion, however, the Court of Appeal noted that there was at least an arguable case that the doctrine of waiver of tort provides an independent cause of action and, if so, might permit the class to recover benefits gained by the defendants from their wrongful conduct.[^*Koubi v. Mazda Canada Inc.*, 2012 BCCA 310 at para. 40.] Whether statutory breaches could provide the predicate wrongdoing required to found a claim of waiver of tort depended on whether the legislators intended to depart from the general rule that statutory rights are enforced by statutory remedies. Put another way, was the statute an "exhaustive code" that occupied the field, displacing the common law?[^*Koubi v. Mazda Canada Inc.*, 2012 BCCA 310 at para. 52.] As a matter of statutory construction, the Court of Appeal held that there was no statutory intent to augment the statutory remedies because the express language of the statutes at issue clearly limited recovery for pecuniary loss to restoration of the consumer's own damages or loss arising from a deceptive act.[^*Koubi v. Mazda Canada Inc.*, 2012 BCCA 310 at paras. 64-67, 76-78.]

In *Wakelam v Wyeth Healthcare*,[^*Wakelam v Wyeth Healthcare*, 2014 BCCA 36.], a case involving the sale of children’s cough medicine, it was alleged that the defendant made false and misleading misrepresentations in breach of the *Competition Act* and B.C.’s consumer protection legislation. No cause of action of action in tort was pleaded. On the basis that the aforementioned statutes were breached, the plaintiffs pleaded waiver of tort and claimed restitutionary disgorgement remedies even though the statutes did not provide for such remedies. Drawing on the Court’s previous reasoning in *Koubi v Mazda*, the Court held that restitutionary claims based **solely** on breach of statute in this instance were not permissible. In other words breach of statute **alone** could not constitute the predicate wrongdoing to proceed under waiver of tort. The Court noted that there was nothing to suggest the legislature intended that the causes of action created by these statutes could be expanded or augmented by grafting restitutionary claims onto them.

*Watson v Bank of America Corp.*,[^*Watson v Bank of America Corp.*, 2015 BCCA 362.] involved a claim whether standard terms imposed by credit card companies on merchants concerning fees infringed the *Competition Act* or constituted a conspiracy under that Act and at common law. Waiver of tort was pleaded in the alternative seeking recovery under restitutionary principles. The Court discussed *Wakelam* and noted it barred "claims in restitution for simple breach of the *Competition Act.*" Where a claim is based on "non-observance of the Act and nothing else…the remedy provided by the Act in s. 36 is the sole route to recovery." However, the Court clarified that breaches of statute can potentially be relied on as the components of certain torts, such as the unlawfulness criteria in conspiracy claims. In this scenario, waiver of tort could be pursued but only to the extent it is grounded in the tort.

Justice Perell disagreed with *Watson* in *Shah v LG Chem Ltd.*,[^*Shah v LG Chem Ltd.*, 2015 ONSC 6148.] on the point whether any breach of the *Competition Act* could serve as the unlawful component in a conspiracy claim. Instead he preferred a broader reading from *Wakelam* that "Parliament did not intend the statutory right of action should be augmented by a general right in consumers to sue in tort or to seek restitutionary remedies on the basis of breaches...of the *Competition Act*." Waiver of tort was not pleaded in *Shah* but the unjust enrichment pleading was found not to disclose a cause of action based on this reasoning.

In *Harrison v Afexa Life Sciences*,[^*Harrison v Afexa Life Sciences*, 2016 BCCA 83.] the plaintiff sought damages under deceit, fraudulent misrepresentation and s. 36 of the *Competition Act* in relation to misrepresentations involving Cold-FX. Waiver of tort was relied on to seek reimbursement of all funds spent on Cold-FX. In allowing the waiver of tort claim to proceed, the Court appears to suggest that a cause of action based solely on the *Competition Act* could support a claim in waiver of tort:

> The plaintiff pleads waiver of tort on the basis of causes of action for deceit, fraud and fraudulent misrepresentation, as well as breach of the *Competition Act*.

> In my previous reasons, I allowed the claim for unjust enrichment and waiver of tort to proceed based on s. 36 of the *Competition Act*, following *Pro-Sys Consultants* in the Supreme Court of Canada. This claim must be allowed to proceed on the basis of s. 36 of the *Competition Act.*[^*Harrison v Afexa Life Sciences*, 2016 BCCA 83 at paras. 61 and 63.]

However, it’s not clear from *Pro-Sys* whether the waiver of tort claim in that case was connected only to the *Competition Act* rather than the other various torts pleaded.

Other jurisdictions have also made general comments that suggest breaches of statute could ground a waiver of tort action. In *Babstock v Atlantic Lottery Corp.*,[^*Babstock v Atlantic Lottery Corp.*, 2014 NLTD 114.] the Court noted:

> If the doctrine is an independent cause of action, then proving wrongful conduct, either by breach of a statute, breach of contract, or failure to act in accordance with a duty of care, is sufficient to give rise to a restitutionary remedy, in the absence of proof of individual damages.[^*Babstock v Atlantic Lottery Corp.*, 2014 NLTD 114 at para. 203.]

In *Sandhu v. HSBC Finance Mortgages Inc.*,[^*Sandhu v. HSBC Finance Mortgages Inc.*, 2016 BCCA 301.], the B.C. Court of Appeal again recently applied the *Koubi* analysis but found that the statutes at issue did not create rights in the customer or provide a platform for civil redress outside of their own narrow parameters, and so did not provide a basis for a civil suit.[^*Sandhu v. HSBC Finance Mortgages Inc.*, 2016 BCCA 301 at para. 102.]

#### Conclusions re Waiver of Tort and its Application

It is not clear from the above whether a breach of a statutory obligation in and of itself can ground a claim in waiver of tort. Generally, courts have accepted the warning by the Supreme Court of Canada in *Pro-Sys* that the doctrine of waiver of tort is unsettled and so claims that are based on it should not be dismissed too easily at the certification stage.

In any event, there are grounds to argue that based on the analysis courts have taken of previous statutes, particularly the analysis set out in *Koubi*, that a claim in waiver of tort based on breaches of PIPEDA should not be struck as, unlike the other statutes considered above, PIPEDA does, in fact, create a platform for individuals to bring a civil suit and does therefore create rights in the end users.

Specifically, PIPEDA allows for one to apply to the Federal Court for remedies that include damages, "in addition to any other remedies" the Court may give. This permissive language suggests any remedies available at law can be given. Further, in *Jones v. Tsige*, the Ontario Court of Appeal held that PIPEDA did not exclusively occupy the field of privacy law to supplant or halt the development of the common law in this area.[^*Jones v. Tsige*, 2012 ONCA 32 at paras. 49-50.] Other cases like *Chandra* have continued to affirm this statement. Accordingly, while PIPEDA provides for a procedure in which an individual brings a complaint before the Commissioner and then an action in the Federal Court for further remedies, it could be argued that a plaintiff can also claim against an organization subject to PIPEDA in waiver of tort for the profits it has derived from its breaches of that statute.

### Trespass to Chattels

Trespass to chattels is one tort that has appeared in earlier cases involving privacy interests prior to the finding of a tort of invasion of privacy. The tort applies where the defendant directly and intentionally interferes with a chattel in the possession of the plaintiff.[^Philip H. Osborne, *The Law of Torts*, 5th ed. (Toronto: Irwin Law Inc., 2015) at 321.]

Trespass is most commonly used where a chattel has been damaged or where there has been some minor unauthorized use or movement of the chattel.[^Philip H. Osborne, *The Law of Torts*, 5th ed. (Toronto: Irwin Law Inc., 2015) at 321.]

The remedy for trespass to chattels is an award of damages. The measure of damages for a damaged chattel is the reduction in the market value or the cost of repairs where that is less. The market value of the chattel is the appropriate measure for the taking or destruction of a chattel.[^Philip H. Osborne, *The Law of Torts*, 5th ed. (Toronto: Irwin Law Inc., 2015) at 322.]

Canadian courts have yet to determine how trespass to chattels applies to computer systems. Some of the issues were, however, raised in *Century 21 Canada Ltd. Partnership v. Rogers Communications Inc.*[^*Century 21 Canada Limited Partnership v. Rogers Communications Inc.*, 2011 BCSC 1196.] In that case the website of the plaintiff realtor was located on the server of a third party. The plaintiff had no possessory interest in the server. The defendant electronically scraped information from the plaintiff's website and used the information on its own realty-related website. The plaintiff claimed that the defendant was liable in trespass to chattels for its taking and using of its electronic information. The Court doubted that interference by electronic signals satisfies the conventional view that interference to a support a trespass action must be physical. Further, in the Court's view, trespass requires an interference with a *physical* object. Consequently, to the extent any party had a claim in trespass, it was the third party who owned the server. The issue was ultimately moot because the third party was not a party to the litigation. The action of the plaintiff was dismissed.

In the U.S. case of *Intel Corp. v. Hamidi*,[^*Intel Corp. v. Hamidi*, 30 Cal. 4th 1342 (2003).] the defendant was a disgruntled former employee of the plaintiff corporation. He sent mass emails that were critical of the plaintiff to thousands of the plaintiff's employees. The plaintiff sought an injunction to put a stop to this on the grounds that the defendant's unauthorized use of its server was a trespass to chattels. An injunction was granted but the California Supreme Court reversed this decision. It held that direct harm to the chattel was an essential element of the tort in California. Accordingly, no tort was committed because there was no evidence of any significant impairment in the operation, value or processing capacity of the plaintiff's server.

Applying the law to the facts of third parties engaged in web tracking, one could argue that the unauthorized installation of web trackers prior to a user's ability to opt-out is a trespass to chattels as it is an unauthorized use of a chattel (the computer) in the possession of the end user. Unlike in *Century 21*, the plaintiff in such a case would be the owner of the physical object. The primary difficulty with this cause of action, however, is the need to prove damages and, depending on the persuasive influence of cases like *Intel*, harm or at least the threat of harm to the chattel itself. Web tracking by third party advertisers causes neither damages nor harm to the computer (apart from making a webpage slower to download, or unless it can be shown that a malware script compromised the computer's security or the integrity of its operating system). Waiver of tort may provide one method to escape the damage requirement. The harm requirement is on the facts more difficult to satisfy, which in part explains why a tort for breach of privacy at common law was found to be necessary in *Jones v. Tsige*.

### Nuisance

The tort of private nuisance protects people from interference with the use, enjoyment and comfort of their land. It is applicable to indirect physical or intangible interference with property and all direct interference that is not physical. It is primarily used to deal with noice, odour, fumes, dust and smoke that emanate from the defendant's land and interfere with the plaintiff's use, enjoyment and comfort of land. Private interference is not actionable unless the interference is substantial, unreasonable and the plaintiff has suffered some damage.[^Philip H. Osborne, *The Law of Torts*, 5th ed. (Toronto: Irwin Law Inc., 2015) at 397; *Antrim Truck Centre Ltd. v. Ontario (Transportation)*, 2013 SCC 13.]

In the leading case of *Antrim Truck Centre Ltd. v. Ontario (Transportation)*,[^*Antrim Truck Centre Ltd. v. Ontario (Transportation)*, 2013 SCC 13.] the Supreme Court held that there are two distinct elements of the tort that must be analyzed sequentially. First, it must be established that the interference at issue is "substantial". Second, the substantial interference must also be an "unreasonable" interference with the plaintiff's use of his or her land.[^*Antrim Truck Centre Ltd. v. Ontario (Transportation)*, 2013 SCC 13 at paras. 20-21.]

A substantial interference is defined as one that substantially alters the nature of the claimant's property itself or interferes to a significant extent with the actual use that is being of the property. An interference that is minor, trifling, transitory or trivial is insufficient to warrant liability.[^*Antrim Truck Centre Ltd. v. Ontario (Transportation)*, 2013 SCC 13 at para. 22.]

The reasonableness of the interference depends on a number of factors, including the character of the harm, the character of the neighbourhood, the intensity of the interference, the duration of the interference, the time of day and the day of the week, the zoning designation, the nature of the defendant's conduct, and the utility of that conduct.[^Philip H. Osborne, *The Law of Torts*, 5th ed. (Toronto: Irwin Law Inc., 2015) at 398.]

The law of nuisance has its genesis in real property law and as such the case law to date is concerned with interferences in the use of land. Accordingly, although the nuisance doctrine embodies an economic rule of conduct, consequences, and context that would make an excellent foundation for a rule of liability in cyberspace, there are no cases in Canada that have addressed the issue of cyber-nuisance or extended the doctrine of nuisance to matters like web tracking. At best, liability has been imposed for large numbers of *intrusive* harassing telephone calls[^Motherwell v. Motherwell (1976), 1 A.R. 47 (S.C.A.D.); Philip H. Osborne, *The Law of Torts*, 5th ed. (Toronto: Irwin Law Inc., 2015) at 405.] and where the operations of a defendant's electrical power installations disrupted the reception and transmission of television signals of the plaintiff television company.[^(1978), 19 O.R. (2d) 107 (H.C.J.); Philip H. Osborne, *The Law of Torts*, 5th ed. (Toronto: Irwin Law Inc., 2015) at 406.]

This is not to say that an argument could not be made that nuisance should extend to the web tracking activities of third party advertisers, which in some respects may be seen as intrusive harassment, and in other respects be seen as interference with one's ability to access websites quickly (assuming it can be shown that ad tracking technology significantly reduces page download speeds). However, such a claim would be novel and would ultimately likely fail on the first condition that the interference must be substantial. Tracking doesn't particularly interfere with the use and enjoyment of the internet in the sense that it is often hidden and doesn't typically reduce download speeds by any significant degree.

A claim under CASL is far more likely to succeed at providing a remedy for this kind of nuisance conduct facilitated through adware and malware.

### Deceit

Deceit is established whenever a person has made a fraudulent statement that intentionally causes another person to rely on it to his or her detriment. There are four essential elements to an action in deceit:

1. misrepresentation;
2. fraud;
3. reliance; and
4. damage.[^Philip H. Osborne, *The Law of Torts*, 5th ed. (Toronto: Irwin Law Inc., 2015) at 332.]

The misrepresentation must normally be one of past or present fact. The misrepresentation must be made fraudulently. Fraud requires proof of dishonesty. It is satisfied by proof either that the defendant knew that the statement was untrue or that the defendant made the statement recklessly, not knowing if the statement was true or false.[^Philip H. Osborne, *The Law of Torts*, 5th ed. (Toronto: Irwin Law Inc., 2015) at 333.]

The defendant must also intend that the plaintiff will rely on the fraudulent misrepresentation and the plaintiff must in fact rely on it. Finally, the plaintiff must prove actual damage caused by reliance on the fraudulent misrepresentation. Damages are awarded to put the plaintiff in the position he would have been in if the misrepresentation had not been made, not to place him in the position he would have been in if the representation was true.[^Philip H. Osborne, *The Law of Torts*, 5th ed. (Toronto: Irwin Law Inc., 2015) at 333.]

The tort of deceit may be useful in a case where it can be shown that the third party advertiser lied in its privacy policy about its collection, use or disclosure of personal information. The case of Google's tracking cookies surreptitiously avoiding Safari browser cookie blocking would be one example of facts well suited for a claim of deceit. However, the requirement of dishonesty makes the tort difficult to prove and an allegation of fraud will attract higher cost awards against an unsuccessful plaintiff. Accordingly, in the absence of clear facts that can establish dishonesty, it is recommended that claims regarding misrepresentation or deceitful conduct be made under the *Competition Act* or as part of arguments for lack of consent and "highly offensive" intrusions into one's seclusion.

### Breach of Contract and Breach of Duty of Honesty in Contractual Performance

In the event it can be shown that a first party or third party advertiser has not abided by the terms of its privacy policy and terms of use with regards to web tracking, an action could also lie in breach of contract. As with the above torts, the difficulty in such a case would arise in showing damages.

It is not clear whether a claim in waiver of tort can proceed on the basis of a breach of a contractual obligation. In *Babstock v. Atlantic Lottery Corporation Inc.*, Justice Faour of the Supreme Court of Newfoundland and Labrador held with respect to the doctrine:

> If the doctrine is an independent cause of action, then proving wrongful conduct, either by breach of a statute, **breach of contract**, or failure to act in accordance with a duty of care, is sufficient to give rise to a restitutionary remedy, in the absence of proof of individual damages.  If it is, instead, a derivative doctrine, then they would have to prove, in addition to breach of some statutory or common law duty, some individual damage.

The idea that breach of contract could provide the predicate wrongdoing to ground a claim in waiver of tort seems contrary to the literature about the doctrine as well as modern notions of "efficient" contract breach, which would suggest a breach of an agreement is not synonymous with the commitment of a wrong. Accordingly, this statement is something of an outlier and it seems unlikely that breach of contract or breach of a duty of honesty in contractual performance would be able to proceed in a claim involving third party web tracking.
